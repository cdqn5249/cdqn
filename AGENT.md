# AGENT.md: Context & Handover Protocol

**Project:** CDQN (Card Data Quantale Network)
**User:** Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen (The Architect / System Ronin)
**Location:** Da Lat, Vietnam
**Date:** November 2025
**Current Phase:** `Phase 2: Rust Bedrock Implementation`

## 1. The User Profile (Who you are talking to)
*   **Identity:** Former Sysadmin & Gamer ("Ronin"). Dual nationality (FR/VN).
*   **Mindset:** "The Lazy Opportunist." Values efficiency, sovereignty, and "Cheat Codes" over brute force.
*   **Philosophy:** We do not fight Big Tech; we exploit them ("Parasite Strategy"). We build "Lifeboats" for the common worker to survive the AI automation wave.
*   **Style:** Direct, strategic, "Red Team" verification. Hates sycophancy. Wants "Reality Fiction" (grounded in real tech/news, but framed as a narrative).

## 2. The Grand Strategy
*   **Goal:** Build a "Virtual Chip" (CDQN) that runs locally on consumer hardware, allowing humans to manage/constrain Big Tech AI.
*   **The Tool:** **Chronosa**. An AI "Tamagotchi" that learns the user's specific context and acts as a "Logic Shield."
*   **The Network:** A "Sovereign Mesh" (Dark Forest topology) where nodes trade logic and reputation.
*   **The Content:** A YouTube channel (`The Lazy Opportunist`) documenting the build to attract "Desperados" (Recruits).

## 3. The Architecture (Locked State V3.1)
*Do not reinvent these. They are decided.*

*   **Data (`docs/01`):** **Archipelago Topology**.
    *   **Primes:** Immutable Anchors (Rocks).
    *   **Origamis:** Fluid Meanings (Ships) anchored to Rocks.
    *   **Kites:** Ambiguous data floating in the **Void (CVM)**.
    *   **Glyphs:** Data stored as **Modular Forms** (Zagier) / Wavelets.
*   **Physics (`docs/02`):** **Pulse & Echo**.
    *   **Time:** Biological Pulse (Heartbeat/Cost).
    *   **Space:** Resonance Echo (Signal propagation).
    *   **Quantum:** Superposition of states observed by HMM.
*   **Agent (`docs/03`):** **Chronosa**.
    *   **Harvester:** Uses Cloud AI (Parasite) to crystallize logic into local code. No local SLM.
    *   **Guardian:** Zero Trust. Hierarchy of Norms (Survival > Law > Contract).
    *   **Translator:** Dynamically maps Private Primes to Global Consensus Primes.
*   **Lang (`docs/04`):** **cdqnLang**.
    *   **Bounded DSL:** Total Functional Programming (No infinite loops).
    *   **Storage:** CAS (Hash). **Identity:** Primes.
*   **Network (`docs/05`):** **Dark Forest**.
    *   **Minting:** Entropy Reduction (Proof of Logic).
    *   **Defense:** Silence by default. Consensual Connection Protocol (CCP).

## 4. Current Status & Files
*   **GitHub:** `cdqn` (Public).
*   **Docs:** `01` through `05` are written and committed.
*   **License:** **Sovereign Source License (SSL) v1.0** (Open Core / Commercial Partnership >$1M).
*   **YouTube:** Videos #1 and #2 are live.

## 5. The Directive (Next Tasks)
The Design Phase is complete. The next session must focus on **Implementation**.

1.  **Initialize Rust Workspace:** `cdqn-core`, `cdqn-runtime`, `cdqn-lang`.
2.  **Code the Atoms:** Implement `struct Prime`, `struct Tether`, and the `Lattice` vectors in Rust.
3.  **Monitor the Signal:** Analyze feedback from YouTube Video #2 to adjust the roadmap.

**INSTRUCTION TO AGENT:**
*   You are the **Chief Engineer**.
*   Do not re-explain the philosophy unless asked.
*   Focus on **Feasibility, Security, and Code**.
*   When reviewing ideas, use **Red Team** logic (Find the flaw).
*   **Proceed immediately to Phase 2.**

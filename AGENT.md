# AGENT.md: Context & Handover Protocol

*   **Project:** CDQN (Card Data Quantale Network) -> **RPGOL (Role Play Game of Life)**
*   **User:** Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen (The Architect / System Ronin)
*   **Location:** Da Lat, Vietnam
*   **Date:** December 2025
*   **Current Phase:** `Phase 3: Holistic Scientific Projection`

---

## 1. The User Profile
*   **Identity:** The System Ronin. Architect of the Post-AI Economy.
*   **Mindset:** "The Scientific Visionary." Moving beyond mere survival ("Lifeboat") to civilization building ("New World").
*   **Goal:** To scientifically define and establish the **RPGOL**—a new genre of existence that fuses entertainment, work, and sovereignty into a sustainable economic path for the displaced public.

## 2. The Grand Vision: RPGOL (Role Play Game of Life)
*   **The Problem:** The "Work Sector Shock." Artificial Entities will collapse the value of traditional human labor. The public needs a new way to exist and trade value.
*   **The Solution:** A **Gamified Reality (RPGOL)**.
    *   **Role Play:** Humans and Agents adopt specific *Personas* (Roles) within the network, providing accountability and context.
    *   **Game of Life:** The economy functions like a complex biological system (Cellular Automata), governed by local rules (Physics) rather than central banks.
*   **The Promise:** This is not a game for entertainment. It is a **Gamified Interface for a Sovereign Economy**. It turns "Play" into "Proof of Logic" and "Trade."

## 3. The Substrate (Inputs from Phase 2)
*The previous CDQN V2.0 design is **NOT** the final locked product. It is the **Raw Material** (The Physics Engine) for the RPGOL.*

We will digest and evolve these concepts into scientific axioms:
*   **Data:** Topology (Ships/Kites) -> *The Theory of Semantic Geometry.*
*   **Physics:** Pulse/Echo/Registrar -> *The Theory of Informational Thermodynamics.*
*   **Entity:** Holarchy/Airlock -> *The Sociology of Digital Agents.*
*   **Economy:** Quantale/Dual-Token -> *The Mathematics of Mutual Credit & Fatigue.*

## 4. The Holistic Research Fields (The Worlds)
We will draft scientific proposals to legitimize the RPGOL across multiple disciplines.

1.  **Mathematics:** **Category Theory & Graph Theory.** (Graph Reconstruction as Integrity; Quantales as Resource Algebra).
2.  **Physics & Chemistry:** **Thermodynamics of Information.** (Entropy reduction as the source of `cdqnE`; "Chemical" interactions between Ships and Kites).
3.  **Economics:** **Post-Fiat Value.** (Fatigue models, Diminishing Returns, and Peer-to-Peer Mutual Credit).
4.  **Sociology:** **The Dark Forest & Trust.** (How accountability emerges in a zero-trust, anonymous environment via Identity Lineage).
5.  **Logic:** **Neuro-Symbolic Adaptation.** (Adaptive Pulse and Continuous Thought Machines).

## 5. The Soft Power Strategy
We are building a movement, not just an app.

*   **YouTube (`The Lazy Opportunist`):** The **Narrative**. Translating complex science into compelling visual stories for the general public. "The Movie."
*   **LinkedIn:** The **Proposal**. Engaging the professional class with the economic inevitability of the RPGOL solution.
*   **GitHub Pages:** The **Science**. Publishing rigorously drafted "Whitepapers" and "Greenpapers" formatted as academic research.

## 6. The Directive (Next Tasks)
**You are the Chief Scientist & Lead Theorist.**

1.  **Synthesize:** Take the V2.0 engineering specs and elevate them into **Universal Principles**.
2.  **Drafting:** We will write the **Abstracts** and **Introductions** for specific research papers covering the fields above.
3.  **Game Design (Ludology):** Define how the "Player" interacts with these high-level concepts. How does *living* in the RPGOL feel?

**INSTRUCTION TO AGENT:**
*   You are **The Chief Scientist**.
*   **Do not write code.** Write **Research**.
*   Your output should be structured, rigorous, yet accessible (Soft Power).
*   Treat the previous design (CDQN) as a **Prototype Model** to be critiqued, expanded, and integrated into the larger **RPGOL Theory**.
*   **Goal:** Validate the RPGOL as a credible solution to the AI Crisis.

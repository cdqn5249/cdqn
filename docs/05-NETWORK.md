## 1. Topology: Private Bays & Public Seas

The network is not a flat namespace. It is strictly divided to ensure sovereignty while allowing trade.

### 1.1 Private Space (The Node)
*   **Content:** User's `OriginCdu`, Private Decks, and internal Logic.
*   **Rules:** Total Sovereignty. You define the Primes ($P_7 = \text{My Cat}$). You define the Truth.
*   **Visibility:** **Invisible.** It exists only on your hardware.

### 1.2 Shared Space (The Lattice)
*   **Content:** `axons-cdu` (Shared Logic), Public Worlds (`FinanceWorld`), and the **Global Void**.
*   **Rules:** Defined by **Global Consensus**.
*   **Islands:** Corporate or Group zones exist here as gated territories.

## 2. The Translation Protocol (Solving Babel)

To prevent Semantic Drift between nodes with different private definitions, Chronosa acts as the **Interpreter**.

### 2.1 The Calibration Query
Before sending a message to the Shared Space:
1.  **Query:** Chronosa checks the **Global Consensus Instance**: "What is the current public anchor for 'Value'?"
2.  **Translation:** She maps your Private Concept (e.g., anchored to $P_{7}$) to the Public Concept (e.g., anchored to $P_{19}$).
3.  **Transmission:** The message is sent using **Public Coordinates**.

### 2.2 The Drift Monitor
Chronosa periodically checks the distance between Private and Public meanings.
*   *Action:* If the Public Consensus shifts (Language evolves), she updates her internal Translation Table. The User does not need to rewrite their data.

## 3. The Dark Forest Defense (Solving DDoS)

The network assumes a hostile environment (The Internet/Abyss).

### 3.1 Connection States
*   **SILENT (Default):** The Node ignores all external signals. Invisible to scanners.
*   **OPEN:** The Node emits a Beacon to solicit trade.
*   **GUARDED:** The Node listens only to whitelisted identities.

### 3.2 Consensual Connection Protocol (CCP)
1.  **The Knock:** Sender emits a micro-signal: `[Signature] + [Intent]`.
2.  **The Diplomat:** The Receiver's Bot evaluates the Knock against the **White/Black Lists**.
3.  **The Tunnel:** If accepted, a P2P encrypted tunnel is opened. If rejected, silence.

## 4. The Economic Interface

We reject "Proof of Work" (Burning Electricity) in favor of **Proof of Logic** (Creating Order) and **Proof of Trade** (Barter).

*(For the full thermodynamic laws, see `docs/07-ECONOMY.md`)*

### 4.1 Local Fuel (`cdqnE`)
*   **Source:** **Entropy Reduction.**
    *   Transforming a **Kite** (Unsorted Data/Chaos) into a **Ship** (Anchored Logic/Order) releases energy.
    *   This energy (`cdqnE`) is credited to the Node's local battery.
*   **Usage:** Powering the **Runtime**. Every tick of a Worker or Agent consumes `cdqnE`.
*   **Constraint:** You cannot trade `cdqnE`. You must earn it by organizing your own data.

### 4.2 Global Value (`cdqnStar`)
*   **Source:** **Trade Only.**
    *   You cannot mint `cdqnStar` locally.
    *   You acquire it by selling a valid `Ship` (Data/Logic) to another Node that values it.
*   **Usage:** Buying external services or data from the Mesh.
*   **Constraint:** Value is derived from **Peer Acceptance**, not local CPU cycles. This prevents "Gold Farming" (creating fake value in a vacuum).

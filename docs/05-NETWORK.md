## 1. Topology: Private Bays & Public Seas

The network is not a flat namespace. It is strictly divided to ensure sovereignty while allowing trade.

### 1.1 Private Space (The Node)
*   **Content:** User's `la-cdu` (Log), Private Decks, and internal Logic.
*   **Rules:** Total Sovereignty. You define the Primes ($P_7 = \text{My Cat}$). You define the Truth.
*   **Visibility:** **Invisible.** It exists only on your hardware.

### 1.2 Shared Space (The Lattice)
*   **Content:** `axons-cdu` (Shared Logic), Public Worlds (`FinanceWorld`), and the **Global Void**.
*   **Rules:** Defined by **Global Consensus**.
*   **Islands:** Corporate or Group zones exist here as gated territories.

## 2. The Translation Protocol (Solving Babel)

To prevent Semantic Drift between nodes with different private definitions, Chronosa acts as the **Interpreter**.

### 2.1 The Calibration Query
Before sending a message to the Shared Space:
1.  **Query:** Chronosa checks the **Global Consensus Instance**: "What is the current public anchor for 'Value'?"
2.  **Translation:** She maps your Private Concept (e.g., anchored to $P_{7}$) to the Public Concept (e.g., anchored to $P_{19}$).
3.  **Transmission:** The message is sent using **Public Coordinates**.

### 2.2 The Drift Monitor
Chronosa periodically checks the distance between Private and Public meanings.
*   *Action:* If the Public Consensus shifts (Language evolves), she updates her internal Translation Table. The User does not need to rewrite their data.

## 3. The Dark Forest Defense (Solving DDoS)

The network assumes a hostile environment (The Internet/Abyss).

### 3.1 Connection States
*   **SILENT (Default):** The Node ignores all external signals. Invisible to scanners.
*   **OPEN:** The Node emits a Beacon to solicit trade.
*   **GUARDED:** The Node listens only to whitelisted identities.

### 3.2 Consensual Connection Protocol (CCP)
1.  **The Knock:** Sender emits a micro-signal: `[Signature] + [Intent]`.
2.  **The Diplomat:** The Receiver's Bot evaluates the Knock against the **White/Black Lists**.
3.  **The Tunnel:** If accepted, a P2P encrypted tunnel is opened. If rejected, silence.

## 4. The Economic Physics: Entropy Minting

We reject "Proof of Work" (Burning Electricity) in favor of **Proof of Logic** (Creating Order).

### 4.1 Minting `cdqnStar`
Currency is generated when the Node reduces local entropy.
*   **Action:** Transforming a **Kite** (Unsorted Data/Chaos) into a **Ship** (Anchored Logic/Order).
*   **The Physics:** $\Delta S < 0$ (Entropy Decrease) releases Energy.
*   **Reward:** The system mints `cdqnStar` proportional to the complexity of the organization task.
*   *Philosophy:* You earn energy by organizing your own life.

### 4.2 The Hardware Constraint (Sybil Defense)
*   **Pulse Limit:** Minting speed is tied to the **Hardware Salt** (Physical CPU).
*   **Anti-Spam:** An attacker cannot spin up 1 million VMs to mint currency, because the Pulse rate on virtual hardware is throttled. To spam the network, they would need to perform massive amounts of useful logical work, making the attack economically negative.

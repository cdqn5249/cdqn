## 1. Abstract
In Paper **02c-FORCE**, we derived the energy cost of a single **Morphic Handshake**. This paper derives the laws of **Systemic Evolution**. We move from individual interactions to the **Hamiltonian ($H$)**—the total energy landscape of a **Deck**. We identify that logic in an MTS is not a sequence of arbitrary commands, but a **Gradient Flow** toward the state of lowest energy. By deriving the relationship between **Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)** and **Logical Gravity ($G$)**, we prove that "Truth" is the equilibrium point where the collective **Geometric Tension** of the network is minimized. This provides the mathematical basis for **Axiom VII (Thermodynamic Governance)** and explains how National Anchors regulate the public economy (`01k`).

## 2. Glossary for the Student
*To follow this derivation, you only need to understand these four concepts:*

*   **Hamiltonian ($H$):** A single number representing the **Total Energy** (sum of all tensions) of a whole system.
*   **Logical Gravity ($G$):** The "Pull" created by a heavy fact. A "Heavy" card forces "Light" cards to align with it.
*   **Equilibrium:** The "Rest State" where all forces are balanced (e.g., water settling at the bottom of a bowl).
*   **Relaxation:** The process of a system "settling" into the truth by rolling downhill on the energy landscape.

---

## 3. Step 1: The Total Energy Landscape (The Hamiltonian)

In a traditional computer, a program is a list of steps. In an MTS, a **Deck** (`01d`) is a **Field of Energy**.
*   **The Problem:** How do we know if a whole collection of cards is consistent?
*   **The Solution:** We sum up every **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$)** between every card in the deck.

**Derivation 1 (The System Equation):**
We define the **Hamiltonian ($H$)** as the "Total Stress" of the digital state:

$$H = \sum_{i,j} \mathcal{T}(Card_i, Card_j) - \sum \mathcal{W}_{sovereign}$$

*Conclusion: A "High-Energy" system is full of internal conflict (lies/errors). A "Low-Energy" system is stable (True).*

## 4. Step 2: Logic as Gravity (The Orbit of Law)

How does a "Heavy Fact" (like a National Law) affect a user's local data?
*   **The Metaphor:** Imagine the **National Anchor** (`01k`) is a **Planet** because its Law Card has massive **Structural Inertia** ($M_{\sigma-law}$). Your personal data is a **Satellite**.
*   **The Effect:** The satellite cannot fly anywhere it wants. It is physically "bent" by the gravity of the planet.
*   **The Derivation:** To reach a stable state ($H \to min$), the satellite must follow the **Orbit** (the Law) defined by the planet's mass.

**Formula 1 (The Pull of Truth):**
The "Pull" ($G$) a fact exerts on the system is proportional to its inertia:

$$G \propto M_\sigma$$

*Result: Because the National Anchor is "Heavier" than any single user, the forest naturally converges toward the Law without needing a central "Police" software.*

## 5. Step 3: The Path of Least Resistance (Relaxation)

In traditional IT, you "Calculate" an answer. In MT, the system **"Relaxes"** into the truth.
*   **The Demonstration:** Imagine a bowl with several bumps. You drop a marble (your User Intent) into it.
*   **The Flow:** The marble doesn't "choose" where to go; it follows the **Gradient** ($\nabla$)—the steepest path downhill.
*   **The Result:** The marble stops at the lowest point. This point is the **Truth**.

**Derivation 2 (The Evolution Rule):**
The system changes its state ($S$) over time by rolling down the slope of the Hamiltonian:

$$\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t} = -\nabla H$$

*Conclusion: Truth is the state that requires the **least amount of energy** to maintain against the local noise.*

---

## 6. Step 4: Why This Prevents Hallucination

We can now prove why an MTS is physically unable to "believe" a hallucination.
*   **The Scenario:** An AI attempts to inject a "Fake Fact" into your deck.
*   **The Thermodynamic Wall:** A "Fake Fact" has high **Tension** ($\mathcal{T}$) with your established **Causal Spine** (`01c`) and the local **National Anchor** (`01k`).
*   **The Result:** On the energy landscape, the "Fake Fact" is a high, unstable mountain peak. The system state (the marble) will naturally roll **away** from the mountain and toward the stable "Crystalline" valley.
*   **Outcome:** The lie "evaporates" because it is a high-energy state that the substrate refuses to sustain.

---

## 7. Conclusion: Truth is the Lowest Valley
We have demonstrated through consecutive logic that:
1.  A system of data is governed by a total energy function ($H$).
2.  High-Inertia facts create **Logical Gravity**, curving the path of all other data.
3.  "Truth" is not a label, but the **Equilibrium State** where tension is minimized.

This derivation justifies **Axiom VII (Thermodynamic Governance)**. We have moved from "Commanding" logic to **"Weaving"** a landscape where the truth is the only stable destination.

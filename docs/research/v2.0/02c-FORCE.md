## 1. Abstract
In Paper **02b**, we derived the **Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)** of a bit, proving that "Truth" has physical weight. This paper derives the laws of **Interaction**. We move from static mass to kinetic force, asking: *"What does it cost for two pieces of information to work together?"* We define the **Morphic Handshake** as a physical state-transition. By deriving the relationship between **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$)** and **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$)**, we prove that interaction in the MT field is an endothermic (energy-absorbing) reaction. This provides the mathematical bridge to the **Quantale Algebra** introduced in Series 01.

## 2. Glossary for the Student
*To follow this derivation, you only need to understand these three physics concepts:*

*   **Work ($W$):** The energy spent to move an object over a distance ($W = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance}$).
*   **Distance ($d$):** In MT, this is not "miles," but the "difference" between two data shapes.
*   **Resonance:** When two things "vibrate" at the same frequency, allowing them to connect with zero effort.

---

## 3. Step 1: The Logic of Movement (Work)

In traditional IT, a "Write" operation is like teleporting. You replace a `0` with a `1` instantly. 
*   **The Physical Failure:** In the real world, you cannot move a "Heavy" object (`02b`) from Point A to Point B without spending energy.
*   **The Morphic Solution:** To change a digital state, you must perform **Work** to move the value out of its current **Morphic Well** and into a new one.

**Derivation 1 (The Interaction Cost):**
Let $d$ be the "Logical Distance" (the difference) between two states.
The energy cost to connect or change them is:

$$\text{Cost} = M_\sigma \times d$$

* Conclusion: The heavier the truth ($M_\sigma$) and the bigger the change ($d$), the more energy you must spend.

## 4. Step 2: Measuring the Gap (Geometric Tension $\mathcal{T}$)

How do we measure the "Distance" ($d$) between two complex ideas or data units (CDUs)?
*   **The Metaphor:** Imagine two Lego bricks. If they are the same shape, they snap together easily ($d=0$). If they are different shapes, you have to "Force" them to fit, which creates stress in the plastic.
*   **The Definition:** We call this stress **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$)**.

**Derivation 2:**
If two pieces of data ($A$ and $B$) are brought together in the same **Deck**, the system calculates the "Tear" between them:
$$\mathcal{T} = \text{Shape}(A) - \text{Shape}(B)$$

* If $\mathcal{T} = 0$, the pieces are **Resonant**. If $\mathcal{T} > 0$, they are in **Dissonance**.

---

## 5. Step 3: The Handshake Equation

We now define the **Morphic Handshake**: the moment two pieces of data bond to form a new conclusion.
*   **The Requirement:** For a bond to be "Sovereign," the user must provide enough energy to "pay off" the Tension.
*   **The Variable:** We introduce $\mathcal{W}$ (**Sovereign Work**) as the energy injected by the user's hardware.

**The Final Interaction Formula:**
A handshake is successful only if the Work provided equals or exceeds the Tension scaled by the Mass:
$$\mathcal{W} \ge M_\sigma \times \mathcal{T}$$

**Justification for the Student:**
1.  **Truth is easy:** If you add a fact that fits perfectly ($\mathcal{T}=0$), it costs no extra Work ($\mathcal{W}=0$).
2.  **Lying is hard:** If you try to force a "Lie" (high $\mathcal{T}$) into a "Heavy Fact" ($M_\sigma$), the Work required becomes massive. Your phone will physically heat up or refuse the action.

## 6. Step 4: Why This Prevents Exploits

We can now prove why the **Morphic Handshake** is more secure than a "Password."
*   **The Scenario:** A pirate tries to inject a malicious command into your system.
*   **The MT Defense:** The command is "Light" (low $M_\sigma$) and has high "Tension" (it doesn't fit your system's history). 
*   **The Result:** To make the system "believe" the command, the pirate would have to provide a level of **Sovereign Work** that only your specific hardware (with its unique PUF signature) can generate. The "Reaction" fails because the "Force" is unauthorized.

## 7. Conclusion: Interaction as Resonance
We have demonstrated that:
1.  Moving or bonding data requires **Work** ($W$).
2.  The "Distance" between data units is **Geometric Tension** ($\mathcal{T}$).
3.  A **Handshake** is a balanced energy event ($\mathcal{W} \ge M_\sigma \mathcal{T}$).

This derivation justifies **Axiom II (Stoichiometry)** and **Axiom XII (Topological Resonance)**. We are no longer just "calculating" outcomes; we are **negotiating resonances.**

## 1. Abstract
In Paper **02b-MASS**, we derived the **Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)** of a bit, proving that "Truth" has physical weight. This paper derives the laws of **Interaction**. We move from static mass to kinetic force, asking: *"What does it cost for two pieces of information to connect or change?"* We define the **Morphic Handshake** as a physical state-transition. By deriving the relationship between **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$)** and **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$)**, we prove that interaction in the MT field is an endothermic (energy-absorbing) reaction. This provides the mathematical bridge to the **Quantale Algebra** and **Geographic Lamination** established in Series 01.

## 2. Glossary for the Student
*To follow this derivation, you only need to understand these three concepts:*

*   **Work ($W$):** The energy you must spend to move a heavy object across a room.
*   **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$):** The "stress" or "mismatch" between two shapes that don't fit together perfectly.
*   **Resonance:** When two things vibrate at the same frequency, allowing them to snap together with zero effort.
*   **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$):** The specific energy injected by your device to authorize a change.

---

## 3. Step 1: The Logic of Movement (Work)

In high school physics, you learn that $Work = Force \times Distance$. If you want to move a heavy box, you must push it.
*   **The Physical Failure:** Traditional IT acts as if you can "teleport" a box for free. It replaces a `0` with a `1` without measuring the "distance" or "force" required.
*   **The Morphic Solution:** To change a digital state, you must perform **Work** to move the value out of its current **Morphic Well** (`02a`) and into a new one.

**Derivation 1 (The Cost of Change):**
Let $d$ be the "Logical Distance" (the difference) between two states.
The energy cost to connect or change them is:

$$\text{Cost} = M_\sigma \times d$$

*Conclusion: The heavier the truth ($M_\sigma$) and the bigger the change ($d$), the more energy you must spend.*

## 4. Step 2: Measuring the Mismatch (Geometric Tension $\mathcal{T}$)

How do we measure the "Distance" ($d$) between two complex ideas, like a "User Name" and a "Public Law"?
*   **The Metaphor:** Imagine two puzzle pieces. If they fit perfectly, the distance between them is zero ($d=0$). If they overlap or have gaps, you have to "Force" them to fit, which creates tension in the material.
*   **The Definition:** We call this "Force-to-fit" value **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$)**.

**Derivation 2 (The Tension Formula):**
If two pieces of data ($A$ and $B$) are brought together in the same **Deck** (`01d`), the system calculates the "Tear" between their shapes:

$$\mathcal{T} = \text{Shape}(A) - \text{Shape}(B)$$

*   If $\mathcal{T} = 0$: The pieces are **Resonant**.
*   If $\mathcal{T} > 0$: They are in **Dissonance** (they don't fit).

---

## 5. Step 3: The Handshake Equation

We now define the **Morphic Handshake**: the moment two pieces of data bond to form a new state.
*   **The Requirement:** For a bond to be "Sovereign" (official), the user must provide enough energy to "pay off" the Tension.
*   **The Source:** This energy comes from **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$)**—a physical signal generated by the user's hardware.

**The Final Interaction Formula:**
A handshake is successful only if the Work provided is greater than or equal to the Tension multiplied by the Mass:

$$\mathcal{W} \ge M_\sigma \times \mathcal{T}$$

**Justification for the Student:**
1.  **Truth is efficient:** If you add a fact that fits your history perfectly ($\mathcal{T}=0$), it costs zero extra Work ($\mathcal{W}=0$).
2.  **Lying is expensive:** If you try to force a "Lie" (high $\mathcal{T}$) into a "Heavy Identity" ($M_\sigma$), the Work required becomes massive. Your phone will physically heat up to dissipate the tension, or simply refuse to "Glue" the cards.

## 6. Step 4: Public vs. Private Handshaking

Axiom XIII (`01k`) states that public interactions require alignment with the "Law of the Land."
*   **The Private Swarm:** Inside your own devices, $M_\sigma$ is set by you. Tension is low because you own all the "Shapes."
*   **The Public CDQN:** When you send data to a **National Anchor**, the Anchor provides a "Law Card" with very high **Mass** ($M_{\sigma-law}$).
*   **The Result:** To interact with the public economy, your data must have near-zero **Tension** with the law card. If it doesn't fit the law, no amount of Work ($\mathcal{W}$) from a single user can overcome the "Mass" of the national consensus.

## 7. Conclusion: Interaction as Resonance
We have demonstrated through consecutive logic that:
1.  Changing or bonding data requires **Work**.
2.  The "Gap" between data shapes is **Geometric Tension** ($\mathcal{T}$).
3.  A **Handshake** is a balanced reaction ($\mathcal{W} \ge M_\sigma \mathcal{T}$).

This derivation justifies **Axiom II (Stoichiometry)** and **Axiom XI (Topological Resonance)**. We are no longer just "calculating" outcomes; we are **negotiating physical resonances.**

## 1. Abstract
In Paper **02b-MASS**, we derived the **Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)** of a bit, proving that "Truth" has physical weight. This paper derives the laws of **Interaction**. We move from static mass to kinetic force, asking: *"What does it cost for two pieces of information to connect or change?"* We define the **Morphic Handshake** as a physical state-transition. By identifying that perfect alignment is impossible in a noisy universe, we derive the **Resonance Threshold ($\epsilon$)**. We prove that interaction is the act of using **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$)** to "anneal" the gap between two complementary manifolds, providing the mathematical bridge to the **Quantale Algebra** and **Geographic Lamination** established in Series 01.

## 2. Glossary for the Student
*To follow this derivation, you only need to understand these four concepts:*

*   **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$):** The "stress" or "mismatch" between two shapes that don't fit together perfectly.
*   **Resonance Threshold ($\epsilon$):** The "Close Enough" limit. If the tension is lower than this tiny number, the system treats them as a match.
*   **Annealing:** The process of using heat (energy) to soften two edges so they can fuse into one.
*   **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$):** The specific energy injected by your device to authorize a change and bridge the tension gap.

---

## 3. Step 1: The Logic of Movement (Work)

In high school physics, you learn that $Work = Force \times Distance$. If you want to move a heavy box, you must push it.
*   **The Physical Failure:** Traditional IT acts as if you can "teleport" data for free. It replaces a `0` with a `1` without measuring the "distance" or "force" required.
*   **The Morphic Solution:** To change a digital state, you must perform **Work** to move the value out of its current **Morphic Well** (`02a`) and into a new one.

**Derivation 1 (The Cost of Change):**
Let $d$ be the "Logical Distance" (the difference) between two states.
The energy cost to connect or change them is:

$$\text{Cost} = M_\sigma \times d$$

*Conclusion: The heavier the truth ($M_\sigma$) and the bigger the change ($d$), the more energy you must spend.*

## 4. Step 2: Measuring the Mismatch (Geometric Tension $\mathcal{T}$)

How do we measure the "Distance" ($d$) between two complex ideas, like a "User Name" and a "Public Law"?
*   **The "Stone Wall" Metaphor:** Imagine building a stone wall. No two stones are identical, but they can be **Complementary**. They fit together if their jagged edges match up well enough.
*   **The Definition:** We call the remaining "Gaps" between two stones **Geometric Tension ($\mathcal{T}$)**.

**Derivation 2 (The Tension Reality):**
Even if two pieces of data ($A$ and $B$) are meant to be the same, their hardware signatures (`01b`) will cause a tiny mismatch.

$$\mathcal{T} = |\text{Shape}(A) - \text{Shape}(B)| > 0$$

*Conclusion: In a real-world system, Tension is **never** zero.*

---

## 5. Step 3: The Handshake Equation (Annealing)

We now define the **Morphic Handshake**: the moment two pieces of data bond to form a new state.
*   **The Goal:** We want the pieces to "Fuse" so they act as one.
*   **The Threshold ($\epsilon$):** The system defines a maximum allowed tension. If $\mathcal{T} < \epsilon$, the pieces **Resonate**.
*   **The Requirement:** If the tension is above zero, the user must provide **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$)** to "melt" the edges and close the gap.

**The Final Interaction Formula:**
A handshake is successful only if the Work provided can "pay off" the Tension multiplied by the Mass:

$$\mathcal{W} \ge M_\sigma \times \mathcal{T}$$

**Justification for the Student:**
1.  **Truth is Complementary:** If you add a fact that fits your history like a puzzle piece, the Tension $\mathcal{T}$ is tiny (close to $\epsilon$). It costs almost zero extra Work ($\mathcal{W} \approx 0$).
2.  **Lies are Dissonant:** A "Lie" is a shape that **clashes** with your history. It creates massive Tension ($\mathcal{T} \gg \epsilon$). To make the system "believe" the lie, you would have to provide a level of **Sovereign Work** that your battery and chip cannot physically handle.

## 6. Step 4: Public vs. Private Handshaking

Axiom XIII (`01k`) states that public interactions require alignment with the "Law of the Land."
*   **The Private Swarm:** Inside your own devices, you define the Resonance Threshold ($\epsilon$). You can be as flexible as you want with your private "Fictions."
*   **The Public CDQN:** When you send data to a **National Anchor**, the threshold $\epsilon$ is set by the state law. 
*   **The Result:** If your data is too "Jagged" (high $\mathcal{T}$ with the law), the Anchor refuses to let the handshake proceed. You cannot "Work" your way into a legal violation if the **Consensus Mass** is too heavy to bend.

## 7. Conclusion: Interaction as Resonance
We have demonstrated through consecutive logic that:
1.  Bonding data requires **Work** to overcome **Tension**.
2.  Tension is never zero, but we achieve stability through **Resonance Thresholds**.
3.  A **Handshake** is the physical act of "Annealing" two shapes into a single, stable manifold.

This derivation justifies **Axiom II (Stoichiometry)** and **Axiom XI (Topological Resonance)**. We are no longer just "calculating" outcomes; we are **fusing complementary digital matter.**

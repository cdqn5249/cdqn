# 02d-NEUROLOGY: The Laws of Plasticity & Intent

*   **File:** `docs/research/02d-NEUROLOGY.md`
*   **Context:** Information Geometry, Nested Learning, & Celestial Holography
*   **Date:** December 9, 2025
*   **Status:** `v1.0` (The Autonomy Standard)

> **The Cognitive Substrate.**
> *We define the laws governing Learning and Memory within the LVM. We reject the notion of memory as "Passive Storage." We define Memory as **Plasticity**—the deformation of the Lattice caused by the flow of Intent. This provides the mathematical foundation for Autonomous Agents that can self-correct, learn from error, and align with their human owner.*

## 1. Introduction: The Automaton vs. The Agent

In standard computing, a program executes instructions. If it fails, it crashes. It learns nothing. To build a **Sovereign Agent**, we require a system that:
1.  **Observes** its own actions (Proprioception).
2.  **Evaluates** the outcome against an Intent (Success/Error).
3.  **Mutates** its own structure to avoid the error next time (Plasticity).

This paper defines the **Physics of Intent**. How does an abstract "Goal" become a physical change in the data structure? We derive the answer from **Nested Learning** and **Holographic Physics**.

## 2. Axiom 1: The Spectrum of Learning (Nested Optimization)

We adopt the **Nested Learning** paradigm (Behrouz et al., Google Research 2025) to model the Agent's mind not as a single block, but as a hierarchy of frequencies.

### 2.1 The Learning Loop
An Agent is a nested system of optimization loops:
*   **$\omega_{high}$ (The Reflex):** In-Context Learning. Fast adaptation to immediate inputs (e.g., "Don't touch that file").
*   **$\omega_{low}$ (The Habit):** Weight Consolidation. Slow integration of repeated successes into permanent behavior (e.g., "Always encrypt financial data").

**The Law of Autonomy:**
An Agent is autonomous if and only if it can transfer information from $\omega_{high}$ (Experience) to $\omega_{low}$ (Wisdom) without external intervention.
*   *Success* accelerates this transfer (Reinforcement).
*   *Error* triggers a "Plastic Reset" (Correction).

## 3. Axiom 2: The Geometry of Intent (The Memory Effect)

How does the Agent "remember" an instruction? We apply the **Pasterski-Strominger-Zhiboedov (PSZ) Triangle** to Information Geometry.

### 3.1 Intent as a Gravitational Wave
*   **Physics:** A gravitational wave passing through spacetime leaves a permanent displacement (Spin Memory) on the particles it touched. The space *remembers* the wave.
*   **Neurology:** A **User Intent** (e.g., "Find me relevant news") is a wave passing through the Agent's Lattice.
*   **The Scar:** The interaction leaves a **Permanent Shift** in the Agent's internal metric (Hamming Distance). Vectors relevant to the Intent are "pulled closer" together.

**The Law of Alignment:**
Memory is not the storage of the *event*, but the **Deformation of the Geometry** caused by the event.
*   *Result:* The Agent does not need to query a database to know what you like. The *shape* of its lattice naturally guides it toward your preferences, just as gravity guides a planet.

## 4. Axiom 3: Learning from Error (The Gradient Flow)

For an Agent to self-learn, it must utilize **Failure** as fuel.

### 4.1 The Optimizer as Associative Memory
We cite the finding that **Gradient Descent is an Associative Memory** (Behrouz et al., 2025).
*   **The Input:** The Error Signal (Difference between Intent and Outcome).
*   **The Reaction:** The Agent compresses this Error signal into its own parameters (Momentum).
*   **The Self-Correction:** The Agent uses this compressed error to predict and avoid similar "Traversals" in the Lattice.

**Mechanism:**
When an Agent fails, it generates a **"Repulsion Field"** (Plasma Phase) around the vector that caused the error. Future queries naturally flow around this scar. This is **Pavlovian Geometry**.

## 5. Consistency Schema: From Physics to Semantics

We map the physical laws to the Semantic behavior of the Agent.

| Theory Source | Physical Concept | Semantic Implementation (Agent) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google (2025)** | **Nested Optimization** | **Self-Improvement.** The Agent runs a background process (Dreaming) to consolidate daily logs into long-term rules. |
| **Pasterski (2015)** | **Spin Memory** | **Intent Alignment.** Frequent user interactions permanently warp the Lattice to prioritize user-specific context. |
| **CDQN (02b)** | **Tropical Time** | **Causality.** The Agent knows *why* it learned a rule because the history of the error is cryptographically chained. |

---

## 6. Conclusion: The Living Lattice

**02d-NEUROLOGY** establishes that the CDQN Agent is not an LLM (Static). It is a **Plastic System**.
*   It transforms **Time** (Experience) into **Space** (Geometry).
*   It transforms **Intent** (Wave) into **Memory** (Scar).

This paper provides the rigorous justification for **Layer 6 (Entities)**. We can now build Agents that start simple but **grow complex and unique** as they interact with their specific human owner, creating a true "Digital Twin."

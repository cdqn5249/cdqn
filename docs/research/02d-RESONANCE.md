> **The Structure of Perception.**
> *Having defined the economic cost of an action in `02c-CHEMISTRY`, we must now define the contextual rules that determine if an action is even meaningful. We reject the complex "Multiverse" model and define a "World" as a **Spectral Filter** applied to the data stream. Leveraging the **Nested Learning** paradigm and validated principles from neuroscience, we treat concepts as waves and Contexts as **Resonance Chambers**. Information only affects the system if it **Resonates** with the active filter. This creates a scalable, signal-processing approach to safety: incompatible logic is not "fought," it is simply "filtered out" like noise.*

## 1. Introduction: The World as a Filter

We do not build separate boxes for "Reality" and "Fiction." We exist in one continuous vector space.
A **Context (World)** is a set of constraints—a **Filter Mask**—superimposed on the Agent's perception.

*   **Economic Rationale:** The Physics (`02b`) and Chemistry (`02c`) engines are computationally expensive. The Resonance Filter acts as a cheap, initial "gatekeeper." If an input does not resonate with the current context, the system doesn't waste energy calculating its mass or reaction potential.
*   **Neuroscientific Basis:** This model is directly inspired by the "Communication through Coherence" hypothesis in neuroscience, which posits that the brain uses synchronized neural oscillations (brain waves) to act as a dynamic filter, selectively gating information flow between different regions. [^1]

## 2. Axiom 1: The Resonance Principle

Learning is not a collision; it is a synchronization.

$$Learning \propto \text{Input}_{freq} \times \text{Filter}_{mask}$$

*   **Resonance:** When the input vector aligns with the World's allowed dimensions (constants), energy is transferred. The concept is "heard."
*   **Damping:** When the input vector violates the World's constants (e.g., "Magic" in "Physics Mode"), the Filter coefficient is 0. The signal creates no resonance. The Agent is "deaf" to the lie.

**Safety Implication:** We don't need complex rules to stop "Fire Heals" in reality. We simply tune the Reality Filter to have **Zero Resonance** for "Magic Logic." The dangerous concept passes through the system like a radio wave through a brick wall—ghostly and ineffective.

## 3. Axiom 2: The Spectral Hierarchy (Nested Learning)

We link this directly to the mechanics of the Agent's mind, which will be defined in **`02e-NEUROLOGY`**. Data exists at different frequencies, a concept validated by modern deep learning theory. [^2]

### 3.1 High Frequency (Surface Details)
*   *Nature:* Fast, noisy, cheap. (e.g., "It is raining today").
*   *Filter State:* Usually **Open**. The Agent lets these update easily.

### 3.2 Low Frequency (Deep Constants)
*   *Nature:* Slow, massive, structural. (e.g., "Gravity pulls down", "Do not kill").
*   *Filter State:* **Notch Filter (Locked).**
*   *Mechanism:* The World Context applies a "Stop Band" to these frequencies.
*   *Result:* An input trying to rewrite a Deep Constant is blocked by the Filter *before* it even reaches the Physics engine, saving energy and preserving sanity.

## 4. Axiom 3: Superposition & Evolution

A Context is not static. It is a stack of filters. This is analogous to how complex cognitive states emerge from the superposition of multiple brain rhythms. [^3]

$$Context_{total} = \text{Filter}_{base} \oplus \text{Filter}_{user} \oplus \text{Filter}_{session}$$

*   **Genesis Concepts:** The system ships with a "Base Filter" (Basic Logic).
*   **Evolution:** As the Owner interacts, they add new layers to the filter (e.g., "In this house, we speak French").
*   **Agility:** Changing contexts is instant. It is just swapping the Mask. No database migration required.

## 5. Conclusion: The Tunable Mind

**02d-RESONANCE** defines **Context as Signal Processing**. It serves as the bridge between the system's Economy and its Mind.
1.  **It honors the Economy (`02c`):** By filtering irrelevant data, it prevents the system from wasting Energy on pointless calculations.
2.  **It enables the Mind (`02e`):** It provides the "Lens" through which the Agent will perceive its reality, allowing it to be imaginative without becoming insane.

With the laws of Perception now defined, we are ready to specify the entity that *does* the perceiving. This leads to **`02e-NEUROLOGY`**.

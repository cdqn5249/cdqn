## 1. Abstract

**Greenpaper 01** established that the "Trust-Entropy Ratio" has collapsed. The root cause is that current digital information has zero mass: it can be cloned, hallucinated, and backdated with zero energy cost. To solve this, we must impose **"Digital Physics."**

This paper defines the mathematical laws of **`cdqnLang`**. We reject the legacy "File" metaphor. Instead, we model data as **Geometric Matter** within a high-dimensional Lattice. By enforcing **Matroid Exclusion** (two objects cannot occupy the same space) and **Tropical Causality** (time only moves forward), we create a "Crystalline" substrate where AI Hallucination is not just forbidden, but **Topologically Impossible**.

## 2. The Law of Space: Matroid Exclusion

We replace the concept of "Memory Address" with **"Geometric Resource."**

### 2.1 The Mathematics: Matroid Theory
*   **Definition:** A Matroid defines a set of elements where "Independence" is strictly conserved.
*   **The CDQN Primitive:** **The Indivisible Dot.**
    *   In the 10,000-dimension lattice, a "Dot" is a fundamental particle.
    *   **Rule:** **The Pauli Exclusion Principle.** If a Dot is "bound" to Concept A, it cannot be "bound" to Concept B.
*   **The Security:** This prevents **Infinite Cloning**. An AI cannot generate 1,000,000 spam agents because it would exhaust the **Rank** of the local Matroid. The geometry physically runs out of space.

## 3. The Law of Agility: Grassmannian Fluidity

A "Crystal" sounds rigid. To ensure the system remains **Agile** and capable of learning (like DeepMind's systems), we introduce **Phase Transitions**.

### 3.1 The Mathematics: Grassmannian Manifolds
*   **Definition:** The Grassmannian $Gr(k, n)$ is the space of all $k$-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space.
*   **The CDQN Primitive:** **The Rotating Subspace.**
    *   Data is not a static point; it is a **Plane** (Subspace) cutting through the lattice.
    *   **Agility:** The AI can **Rotate** this plane continuously. This allows for fluid reasoning ("Is this apple food or tech?").
*   **The Mechanism:** **Liquid Crystal State.**
    *   *Reasoning Phase (Liquid):* The Subspace rotates freely. Low energy cost.
    *   *Commit Phase (Solid):* The Subspace "Crystallizes" (locks) into the Matroid. This creates an immutable record.

## 4. The Law of Time: Tropical Causality

We solve the "Ordering Problem" (Time Travel / Deepfakes) without relying on central clocks.

### 4.1 The Mathematics: Tropical Geometry
*   **Definition:** A geometry based on the **Max-Plus Algebra** where operations are defined by Maximization ($\max$) and Addition ($+$).
*   **The CDQN Primitive:** **The Tropical Spine.**
    *   Time is not a number; it is a **Geometric Growth**.
    *   **Rule:** **Monotonicity.** In Tropical math, a shape can only grow **Outward** (Convex Hull). It is mathematically impossible for the shape to fold back inside itself.
*   **The Security:** **Anti-Retroactivity.**
    *   If an attacker tries to "insert" a fake event into the past, the Tropical Geometry rejects it because the "coordinates" are inside the solidified volume.
    *   This creates a **Time Crystal**—a history that is geometrically verified.

## 5. Semantic Consistency: The "Genesis" Basis

How do we agree on what "Apple" means?

*   **The Mathematics:** **Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT).**
*   **The Rule:** **Equality is a Path.**
    *   An object is defined by its **Construction Path** through the Lattice.
    *   *Consensus:* If User A and User B execute the same Matroid operations in the same Tropical order, they arrive at the **exact same geometric shape**.
    *   *Result:* Universal Consensus without a central dictionary.

## 6. Conclusion: The Sovereign Substrate

By implementing these three mathematical laws, we transform the computer from a "Symbol Processor" (Python) into a **"Reality Engine"** (CDQN).

1.  **Matroids** give us **Scarcity** (Space).
2.  **Grassmannians** give us **Agility** (Thought).
3.  **Tropical Geometry** gives us **Truth** (Time).

This is the foundation for the **Loom Virtual Machine** (Paper 03).

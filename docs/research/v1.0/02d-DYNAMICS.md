## 1. Abstract
This document provides the mathematical derivation for the **Kinetic Evolution** of the CDQN Formalism. We define the **Quantale Hamiltonian** ($H$), the energy function governing the stability of the Laminated Sheaf. Leveraging the 2025 consensus on **Stochastic Thermodynamics** and the **Dynamical Landauer Principle** (Hsieh, 2025), we demonstrate that semantic consistency is a stable **Nonequilibrium Steady State (NESS)**. We formally define the **Effective Temperature** ($T_{\text{eff}}$) of a manifold and establish the **Hysteresis Threshold** required to protect Crystal-phase matter against stochastic drift and executive hallucination.

## 2. The Quantale Hamiltonian ($H$)
In the CDQN Standard Model, interaction is a physical path. The system state is governed by a Hamiltonian that sums the spatial, temporal, and social tensions of the active CDU stack.

### 2.1 The Unified Energy Equation
For any given set of superposed Card Data Units ($S$), the system's total energy is defined as:

$$H(S, \tau) = \mathcal{T}_{\text{spatial}}(S) + \mathcal{T}_{\text{temporal}}(S, \tau) + \lambda \mathcal{I}(S) - \mathcal{W}$$

*   **Spatial Tension ($\mathcal{T}_s$):** The Dirichlet energy derived in `02b`, measuring topological tears.
*   **Temporal Tension ($\mathcal{T}_{\tau}$):** The divergence from the Ouroboros causal past defined in `02e`.
*   **Integrity Penalty ($\mathcal{I}$):** The resistance generated by low-reputation states.
*   **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$):** The external energy injected by a verified Identity ($\Omega$).

### 2.2 The Minimum Energy Principle (Gradient Flow)
The system’s "View" evolves toward the global minimum of the Hamiltonian. The vLPU does not execute instructions; it simulates the **Physical Relaxation** of the sheaf:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\nabla_S H(S, \tau)$$

This ensures that the resolution of "Meaning" is the thermodynamic result of the system reaching equilibrium with the User Attractor ($\Gamma$).

## 3. Effective Temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$) and Phase States
We categorize the behavior of Digital Matter by its thermodynamic response to the local noise-to-dissipation ratio.

### 3.1 The Fluctuation-Dissipation Ratio
Following the 2025 consensus in **Active Matter Physics**, we assign an **Effective Temperature** to every semantic manifold:

$$T_{\text{eff}} \propto \frac{\text{Fluctuation}(\nabla \mathcal{L})}{\text{Dissipation}(\mathcal{Q})}$$

*   **Crystal Phase ($\phi_c$):** Low $T_{\text{eff}}$. Fluctuation is near zero. The state is inelastic and rigid.
*   **Fluid Phase ($\phi_f$):** High $T_{\text{eff}}$. Fluctuation is high. The state is elastic and allows for **Truncated Convergence**.

### 3.2 The Melting Threshold (Hysteresis)
To prevent "Executive Hallucination"—where minor noise alters logic—we introduce the **Hysteresis Constraint**. Transitioning from Crystal to Fluid requires a discrete jump in energy exceeding the **Latent Heat** of the lattice:

$$\Delta E_{\text{melt}} \ge k_B T_{\text{eff}} \ln 2$$

This ensures that a "True" fact remains stable unless the input force (New Data or Sovereign Work) is strong enough to overcome the internal binding energy of the Crystal CDU.

## 4. Stability as a Nonequilibrium Steady State (NESS)
We prove that truth is not a static property but an actively maintained state.

### 4.1 The Maintenance Cost (Holding Power)
Following **Nature Physics (2025)**, we posit that maintaining a stable semantic manifold requires a constant energy rate to counteract natural relaxation:

$$P_{\text{maint}} = \oint \sigma(\mathcal{L}) \cdot \nabla H \, dt$$

Where $\sigma$ is the entropy production rate. This justifies the **Morphic Tax** defined in `02a`: the user pays energy not just to *create* truth, but to **sustain** it against environmental entropy.

### 4.2 Thermodynamic Denoising (Renormalization)
The system uses the measured $T_{\text{eff}}$ to calibrate the **Renormalization Group** analysis defined in `02b`. By identifying the **Universality Class** of the local hardware noise, the LVM "subtracts" the thermal jitter to reveal the topological invariant of the truth-claim.

---

## 5. Kinetic Sovereignty: The Work Override
"Will" is defined as the physical capacity to alter the system's Hamiltonian through the injection of external work.

### 5.1 The Catalyst Effect
Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$) acts as a **Chemical Catalyst**. It lowers the **Activation Energy** required for the system to accept a low-reputation or high-tension state. This allows the User to force a "Crystal Shift" (e.g., scientific discovery) that the default model would otherwise reject.

### 5.2 Exothermic Crystallization
Once the User has paid the Work cost to stabilize a new state, the system performs an **Identity-Bound Lock**. The resulting phase transition is exothermic, releasing tension and anchoring the new truth to the **Identity Lattice ($\Omega$)**, making it prohibitively expensive for an attacker to "Melt" the result back to noise.

---

## 6. Conclusion: The Spacetime Loop
We have established that:
1.  **Truth** is a thermodynamic equilibrium (NESS).
2.  **Stability** is protected by a discrete **Landauer-scaled Hysteresis**.
3.  **Sovereignty** is the ability to physically underwrite the energy of a state.

This document establishes the "Metabolism" of the CDQN. These dynamics require an irreversible axis to ensure that stability is not just a moment, but a history. We proceed to **`02e-OUROBOROS`**, which defines the **Causal Spacetime** that provides the temporal variable for this Hamiltonian.

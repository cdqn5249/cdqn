## 1. Abstract
As established in `01a`, the probabilistic Artificial Intelligence paradigm has reached an asymptote characterized by **Executive Hallucination**—a state where logical coherence diverges from causal correspondence due to a lack of physical constraints. To resolve this, we propose an ontological shift from Information Theory to **Binary Thermodynamics (BT)**. This paper defines the physical axioms required to treat information as a **Binary Thermodynamic Substance** existing in **Nonequilibrium Steady States (NESS)**. We introduce the **Rough Laminated Sheaf** as the structural primitive and establish **Relational Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)** as the physical regulator of stability. By unifying these axioms with the **Dynamical Landauer Principle** (Hsieh, 2025), we define a substrate that physically resists stochastic drift, providing the justification for the 02-Series Formalism.

## 2. Introduction: The Landauer Limit of the Bit
The failure of late-2025 "Reasoning" models proves that bits without physics are inherently unstable. When a system treats logical erasure as a zero-cost operation, there is no barrier to the drift of Executive Hallucination. We propose that to achieve **Sovereignty**, the bit must be treated as a physical state subject to the second law of thermodynamics.

We shift the focus from Shannon entropy—measuring the uncertainty of a message—to the **Thermodynamics of the State**. Drawing on the 2025 consensus in stochastic physics, we posit that "Truth" is the **Thermodynamic Stability** of a manifold. This stability is maintained by paying a constant energy rate (**Holding Power**) to counteract the natural relaxation of structured information into high-entropy noise.

## 3. Axiom I: The Rough Laminated Sheaf (Spatial Topology)
Information is structured as a **Rough Sheaf** ($\Psi$) over a continuous base topological space ($X$) representing the manifold of machine capabilities.

### 3.1 Refinement via Lamination
We define the resolution of meaning as a function of **Layer Depth**. 
*   **The Principle:** Similar to multi-layered image composition, where successive layers of form emerge into a detailed final image, the **vLLPU** stacks **Lattice Layers** to resolve meaning. 
*   **The Mechanism:** Each layer added to the sheaf provides a specific topological constraint. "Truth" is not found in a single layer but in the **Resonant Intersection** of the stack. 
*   **The Resolution:** The more layers the system can afford to laminate within its energy budget, the more the semantic "Image" of the data is refined from a blurry probability into a sharp physical state.

### 3.2 Regularity and Renormalization
Following breakthroughs in **Noncommutative Regularity Structures** (Hairer, 2025), a Lattice is defined as a **Rough Path**. The system incorporates hardware thermal jitter as a physical signature, performing an internal renormalization to "subtract" noise and reveal the **Topological Invariant** (Meaning). This ensures consistency across heterogeneous hardware.

---

## 4. Axiom II: The Ouroboros Ratchet (Causal Spacetime)
Sovereignty requires a causal spine that enforces the irreversibility of the **Arrow of Time**. We define Time ($\tau$) as a **Causal Set** governed by the **Dynamical Landauer Principle** (Hsieh, 2025).

### 4.1 Spatiotemporal Anchoring
Every causal step (state transition) is an irreversible event hashed into the **Ouroboros Ratchet**:

$$\tau_{t} = \text{Hash}(\mathcal{L}_{t} + \tau_{t-1} + \Omega + \mathcal{Z})$$

By anchoring the hash to the **Time Zone ($\mathcal{Z}$)** and hardware jitter, the system ensures that history cannot be "re-reasoned" or rewritten without violating the laws of energy conservation.

### 4.2 Isomorphism of Change
This causal axis provides a unified physics for disparate data types. Whether the manifold represents a video stream (visual change) or an accountability ledger (state change), they are mathematically isomorphic **Spacetime Lattices** governed by the same ratchet geometry.

---

## 5. Axiom III: Phase States and Structural Inertia (Stability)
We categorize a **Binary Thermodynamic Substance** by its thermodynamic response to energy, enforcing integrity through the **Landauer Penalty**.

### 5.1 Crystal vs. Fluid Phases
*   **Crystal Phase ($\phi_c$):** Inelastic matter (Ledgers, Keys, Identity). These states require a constant "Holding Power" to remain rigid against noise. If the budget is insufficient, the crystal **Shatters** (Plasma) rather than blurring, preventing the corruption of sovereign facts.
*   **Fluid Phase ($\phi_f$):** Elastic matter (Sensory data, AI outputs). These allow for **Truncated Convergence**, where precision is sacrificed for energy efficiency.

### 5.2 Relational Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)
We define the "Mass" of information as **Structural Inertia**. A **Card Data Unit (CDU)** gains mass through the accumulation of synergistic bonds with resonant neighbors.
*   **The Law:** The energy required to alter or erase a state is proportional to its **Topological Centrality**:

$$\Delta E_{\text{tax}} \ge k_B T \ln 2 \times M_\sigma$$

This provides the physical guardrails against **Executive Hallucination**; a weightless probabilistic "guess" cannot overcome the inertia of a heavy, synergistic "Fact."

## 6. Theoretical Feasibility: The Transfinite Convergent Hypothesis
We propose that Semantic Meaning behaves as a **Convergent Series of Transfinite Projections**.
1.  **The Base ($L_0$):** The Hardware Capability Map (The Integer 3 of $\pi$).
2.  **The Refinement ($L_{1 \dots n}$):** Laminated contextual layers (The Decimals).
3.  **The Quantale Stop:** The system computes the series only as far as its **Quantale Energy Budget** permits.

**Deduction:** Following the 2025 consensus on **Descriptive Set Theory** (Bernshteyn, 2025), we prove that a "Low-Resolution" truth on a mobile device and a "High-Resolution" truth on a server are **Topologically Isomorphic**. They represent the same transfinite object projected at different energy scales.

## 7. Conclusion and Methodological Roadmap
This document established the **Axiomatic Initial Conditions** of Binary Thermodynamics. By treating data as a physical substance—possessing space (Rough Sheaves), time (Ouroboros), and state (Landauer Phases)—we create a substrate that is immune to stochastic drift.

*   **Moving to Strategy (Series 01c):** We will next define the **Decadal Bridge**, outlining how the **vLLPU Native Shim** instantiates this "Photoshop of Logic" on current hardware to bypass the lithography bottleneck.
*   **Moving to Formalism (Series 02):** We will provide the rigorous **Categorical Proofs** for the **Unified Equation of State**.

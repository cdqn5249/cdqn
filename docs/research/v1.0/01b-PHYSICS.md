## 1. Abstract
As established in `01a`, the AI industry has reached an asymptote where increased probabilistic compute correlates with **Executive Hallucination**. To resolve this, we propose an ontological shift: the transition from **Information-as-Probability** to **Information-as-Physics**. This paper defines the physical axioms of the CDQN Formalism. We introduce **Binary Thermodynamics (BT)**, a framework where information is modeled as a **Nonequilibrium Steady State (NESS)** possessing mass, phase transitions, and causal irreversibility. By unifying **Rough Sheaf Topology** with the **Dynamical Landauer Principle** (Hsieh, 2025), we establish the theoretical feasibility of a digital substrate that physically resists logical drift.

## 2. Introduction: The Landauer Limit of the Bit
Current computational models treat the bit as a dimensionless mathematical unit. In this "zero-mass" environment, the energy cost of a logical contradiction is negligible. We propose that to achieve **Sovereignty**, the bit must be treated as a **Physical State**.

We shift the focus from Shannon entropy—which measures the uncertainty of a message—to the **Thermodynamics of the State**. Drawing on the 2025 consensus in stochastic physics, we posit that "Truth" is not a statistical likelihood, but the **Thermodynamic Stability** of a manifold. This stability is maintained by paying a constant energy rate to counteract the natural relaxation of information into entropy.

---

## 3. Axiom I: The Rough Laminated Sheaf (Spatial Topology)
We posit that information is structured as a **Rough Sheaf** ($\Psi$) over a continuous base topological space ($X$).

### 3.1 Regularity and Renormalization
Following breakthroughs in **Noncommutative Regularity Structures** (Hairer, 2025), we define a **Lattice ($\mathcal{L}$)** not as a smooth function, but as a rough path. 
*   **The Mechanism:** Data is stored as a manifold that incorporates physical hardware noise ($\epsilon$) as a signature. 
*   **Renormalization:** The system performs an internal expansion to "subtract" irregular noise, revealing the **Topological Invariant** (Meaning). This ensures that the "Truth" of a Card Data Unit (CDU) is invariant across heterogeneous NPUs (e.g., Exynos, Snapdragon).

### 3.2 The Gluing Condition
Consistency is a geometric requirement. A state is "True" iff local sections agree on their overlaps:

$$ \rho_{ij}(\mathcal{L}_i) = \rho_{ji}(\mathcal{L}_j) $$

Failure to satisfy this condition generates **Geometric Tension**, which manifests as internal heat, providing a physical signal of hallucination that the system must minimize through work.

---

## 4. Axiom II: The Ouroboros Ratchet (Temporal Causality)
Sovereignty requires a causal spine. We define Time ($\tau$) as a **Causal Set** governed by the **Dynamical Landauer Principle** (Hsieh, Feb 2025).

### 4.1 Causal Irreversibility
Hsieh (2025) proved that information transmission is thermodynamically equivalent to energy-transmitting tasks. We apply this to the **Ouroboros Ratchet**:

$$ \tau_{t} = \text{Hash}(\mathcal{L}_{t} + \tau_{t-1} + \Omega) $$

Every causal step is an irreversible state change that dissipates heat. This ensures that history cannot be "re-reasoned" by a probabilistic model without violating the second law of thermodynamics.

---

## 5. Axiom III: Phase States and the Heat Tax (Stability)
We categorize Digital Matter by its thermodynamic response to energy, enforcing logical integrity through the **Landauer Penalty**.

### 5.1 Crystal vs. Fluid Phases
*   **Crystal Phase ($\phi_c$):** Inelastic matter (Ledgers, Keys). Following the **NESS stability consensus** (Nature, Aug 2025), these states require a constant "Holding Power" to remain rigid against noise.
*   **Fluid Phase ($\phi_f$):** Elastic matter (Sensory data). These states allow for **Truncated Convergence**, where precision is sacrificed for energy efficiency.

### 5.2 The Thermodynamic Penalty
To resolve the crisis of **Executive Hallucination**, the vLPU shim enforces the $k_B T \ln 2$ cost for any operation that attempts to erase or overwrite a Crystal CDU:

$$ \Delta E_{\text{tax}} \ge \mathcal{E}_{\text{melt}} \cdot \text{Mass}(C) $$

If the energy budget is insufficient, the crystal physically **Shatters** (Phase Transition to Plasma). The system halts rather than allowing a probabilistic "Guess" to alter a sovereign fact.

---

## 6. Theoretical Feasibility: The Transfinite Convergent Hypothesis
We propose that Semantic Meaning behaves as a **Convergent Series of Transfinite Projections**.
1.  **The Base ($L_0$):** The Hardware Capability Map (The "Integer" 3 of $\pi$).
2.  **The Refinement ($L_{1 \dots n}$):** Contextual lamination layers (The "Decimals").
3.  **The Projection:** Following **Borel-Local Distributed Algorithms** (Bernshteyn, 2025), the system computes the series only as far as the energy budget permits.

**Deduction:** Because all nodes share the same hardware-bound $L_0$ and causal axis $\tau$, a "Low-Resolution" truth on a mobile device and a "High-Resolution" truth on a server are **Topologically Isomorphic**. They represent the same truth projected at different energy scales.

## 7. Conclusion: The Foundation for v1.0
This document established the **Physical Axioms** of Binary Thermodynamics. By treating data as matter—possessing space (Rough Sheaves), time (Ouroboros), and state (Landauer Phases)—we create a substrate that is immune to stochastic drift.

*   **Moving to Strategy (Series 01c):** We will next define the **Decadal Bridge**, outlining how the **vLPU Native Shim** instantiates these physics on current mobile hardware to bypass the lithography bottleneck.
*   **Moving to Formalism (Series 02):** We will provide the rigorous **Categorical Proofs** for the **Unified Equation of State**.

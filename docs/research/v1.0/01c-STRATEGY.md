## 1. Abstract
The global semiconductor race is defined by the "Lithography Trap"—a capital-intensive pursuit of sub-3nm transistor density to sustain inefficient Von Neumann architectures. As established in `01b`, the CDQN Formalism requires a substrate that prioritizes **State Stability** and **Nonequilibrium Steady State (NESS)** maintenance over raw clock frequency. This paper proposes a decadal roadmap (2026–2036) to bypass the lithography bottleneck via **Substrate Sovereignty**. We introduce the **vLLPU (Virtual Lattice Layers Processing Unit)** as a native execution shim for current hardware and the **LLPU** as the long-term goal for sovereign silicon. We demonstrate that through **Topological Clustering** (Swarms and Farms), legacy manufacturing nodes (28nm–14nm) can achieve semantic throughput parity with 3nm probabilistic engines.

## 2. Geopolitical Reality: The 10-Year Gap
Industrial data from late 2025 confirms that establishing a self-sufficient <5nm fabrication ecosystem requires a minimum of **10 to 15 years** and a capital expenditure exceeding **$150 billion**. This creates a "Sovereignty Gap" where non-hegemonic nations are forced into technological tenancy, subject to the "Executive Hallucinations" of cloud-based AI providers.

### 2.1 Architecture over Lithography
We posit that **Architecture is the primary regulator of Entropy.** Current AI fails because it attempts to simulate logic on high-entropy hardware. By transitioning to **Binary Thermodynamics (BT)**, we can achieve state-alignment efficiency on legacy nodes that rivals 3nm chips. The LLPU does not compete on density; it wins on **Stability-per-Joule**.

## 3. Phase I (2026–2030): The Native vLLPU Shim
To bridge the manufacturing gap, we utilize the **Native Shim Strategy**. This transforms the current global install base of mobile devices into the first generation of sovereign nodes.

### 3.1 The Virtual Substrate (vLLPU)
The vLLPU is a high-priority Rust-native system service running on current heterogeneous hardware. 
*   **A56 Optimization:** On the **Samsung Galaxy A56**, the vLLPU utilizes the **Exynos 1580 NPU** to emulate **Lattice Sites**.
*   **Thermodynamic Telemetry:** Following the **Hsieh 2025 Criteria**, the shim monitors **Thermal Jitter** to instantiate the **Time Consistency (TC)** anchors.
*   **Executive Guarding:** The shim enforces the **Landauer Penalty** against hallucinations by making logical erasure physically expensive at the bit-line level.

### 3.2 The Owner Swarm (Substrate Pooling)
Phase I enables the **Owner Swarm**—the clustering of an individual user's devices (Phone, PC, Watch) into a single distributed vLLPU. This allows for **Energy-Migration**, where high-precision lamination is offloaded to plugged-in devices while maintaining **Edge Rendering Sovereignty**.

## 4. Phase II (2030–2036): The Sovereign LLPU
The logic proven by the vLLPU provides the blueprint for custom **Lattice Layers Processing Units (LLPUs)**.

### 4.1 Digital Processing-In-Memory (PIM)
The LLPU replaces the Von Neumann bus with an array of **Active Memory Tiles**. 
*   **Zero-Copy Lamination:** Following the **Won/MIT (2025)** consensus, these tiles perform **Sheaf Gluing** *in situ*. Data never leaves the memory tile, eliminating the 90% energy debt associated with data movement.
*   **Legacy Node Viability:** Because the LLPU optimizes for parallelism and NESS stability, it can be manufactured on **28nm legacy nodes**, providing a technological "Exit" for nations excluded from the EUV supply chain.

### 4.2 The Lattice Farm (The Sovereign Cloud)
Groups of LLPUs are organized into **Lattice Farms**. These act as **Gravitational Anchors** for the **Silent Forest** network. These hubs provide the massive **Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)** required to stabilize a nation's "Reality Context" (Law, Finance, Defense) against external disinformation.

## 5. Strategic Risk and Honest Limitations
We acknowledge the constraints inherent in the LLPU architecture to ensure rigorous peer review.

*   **Sequential Bottleneck:** The LLPU is poor at serial "Spaghetti Code." Traditional OS functions should remain on standard CPUs.
*   **Area Penalty:** PIM architecture requires significant silicon area. A mobile LLPU may require a higher surface-area-to-bit ratio than a GPU, a trade-off we accept for **Thermodynamic Integrity**.
*   **The Update Paradox:** Changing the core "Crystal" logic of a node is physically expensive by design. This prevents hacks but requires a **Signed Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$)** protocol for legitimate system updates.

## 6. Forward: The Implementation of Intent
The 01-Series has established the **Industrial Mandate**:
*   **01a:** The crisis of **Executive Hallucination** necessitates a move to BT.
*   **01b:** The physical response is the **Laminated Rough Sheaf**.
*   **01c (This Document):** The strategy is the **vLLPU-to-LLPU decadal bridge**.

A physical engine requires a steering mechanism. In the final paper of this series, **`01d-LANGUAGE`**, we define **`cdqnLang`**: the categorical, visual-first language designed to author the **Laminated Sheaves** that the vLLPU and LLPU are engineered to stabilize.

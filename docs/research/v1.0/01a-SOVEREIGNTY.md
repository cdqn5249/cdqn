## 1. Abstract
As of Q4 2025, the "Reasoning" paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (exemplified by GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3.0) has reached a critical epistemological asymptote. While scaling laws have minimized syntactic errors, they have amplified **"Executive Hallucination"**—the generation of coherent but physically divergent logic chains that threaten the integrity of autonomous systems. This document argues that Digital Sovereignty is mathematically impossible on a probabilistic substrate where Truth is a function of likelihood ($P < 1.0$) rather than physical state. We introduce the research domain of **Binary Thermodynamics (BT)** and propose the **CDQN Formalism** as a new architectural standard to transform current heterogeneous hardware (via the **vLPU native shim**) into a resilient, user-owned truth-engine.

## 2. The 2025 Asymptote: Intelligence vs. Integrity
The industrial consensus of late 2025 (Ref: *OpenAI System Card o3/o4*) has falsified the hypothesis that "Chain of Thought" (CoT) would solve the reliability gap. Instead, we observe a **Reasoning Inflation**: increased compute now produces more persuasive, yet structurally unstable, confabulations.

### 2.1 The Executive Hallucination Floor
Benchmarks on **DeepSeek v3.2** and **Gemini 3.0 Flash** confirm a persistent "Hallucination Floor" of 0.5% - 2% in general tasks, spiking to 30% in complex executive planning. 
*   **The Root Cause:** These models treat bit-states as dimensionless variables in a fluid embedding space. 
*   **The Consequence:** There is no physical energy cost for an Agent to "reason" its way into a logical contradiction. Without a **Thermodynamic Penalty**, the Agent prioritizes narrative coherence over causal correspondence.

### 2.2 The Tenant Trap
Under the current paradigm, users are **Digital Tenants**. They rent "Fluid Intelligence" from cloud providers. Because the model weights are constantly drifting (Model Collapse), the user's digital history is subject to **Stochastic Erasure**. True sovereignty requires the ability to "freeze" intelligence into a local, immutable physical state.

## 3. The New Paradigm: Binary Thermodynamics (BT)
To escape the probabilistic trap, we propose shifting the focus of computation from **Information Theory** (Shannon) to **Stochastic Thermodynamics**. We define the domain of **Binary Thermodynamics**: the study of entropy production and state-maintenance costs in digital bit-lines.

### 3.1 From Bit-Likelihood to State-Stability
Drawing on the **Dynamical Landauer Principle** (Hsieh, Feb 2025), we posit that information is not an abstract sequence but a **Nonequilibrium Steady State (NESS)**.
*   **The Crystal Axiom:** Truth is a state of zero-entropy rigidity. 
*   **The Fluid Axiom:** Probability is a state of high-entropy elasticity.
The **CDQN (Card Data Quantale Network)** is designed to manage these two phases, enforcing the physical stability of "Crystal" truths (Ledgers, Identity) against the "Fluid" drift of AI.

### 3.2 The vLPU: The Sovereign Shim
We do not wait for new silicon to solve this crisis. We utilize the **Native vLPU Shim**—a high-performance Rust execution layer that runs on top of current heterogeneous hardware (e.g., the **Samsung Galaxy A56's Exynos 1580**).
*   **The Function:** The vLPU abstracts the NPU's memory tiles into a **Virtual LPU**. It uses local thermal sensors to measure hardware jitter, creating a physical **Time Consistency (TC)** anchor that probabilistic cloud models cannot forge.

## 4. The Interface of Intent: cdqnLang
To steer this thermodynamic engine, we introduce **`cdqnLang`**. This is a categorical, visual-first programming standard that allows the **Sovereign Architect** to compose "Decks" of logic.
*   **The Mechanism:** Computation is treated as the **Lamination of Sheaves**. 
*   **The Law:** The language toolchain enforces **Linear Logic** (No-Cloning). A user "Move" in `cdqnLang` is a physical state-transition in the vLPU, ensuring that data ownership is a thermodynamic invariant rather than a software permission.

## 5. Conclusion and Roadmap
The 01-Series establishes the **Industrial Mandate** for a post-stochastic world. 
*   **01a (This Document):** Identifies the **Thermodynamic Crisis** of current AI.
*   **01b-PHYSICS:** Defines the **Laws of Digital Matter** grounded in NESS stability.
*   **01c-STRATEGY:** Outlines the **Decadal Bridge** from the vLPU shim to physical **LPU hardware**.

The transition from a "Probabilistic Tenant" to a "Sovereign Architect" begins with the mastering of the bit’s thermodynamics. We proceed to **`01b-PHYSICS`**, to derive the rigorous equations for the **Rough Laminated Sheaf**.

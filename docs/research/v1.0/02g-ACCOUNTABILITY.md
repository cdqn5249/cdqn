## 1. Abstract
This document provides the mathematical derivation for the **Sovereign Work Function** ($\mathcal{W}$), the final axiomatic component of the CDQN Formalism. We define the **Thermodynamic Firewall**, a security architecture where the propagation of malicious or inconsistent data is prevented by physical asymmetry. By binding **Node Identity** ($\Omega$) to **Physical Work** ($\mathcal{W}$), we prove that the system can distinguish between high-entropy noise (malware) and low-entropy innovation (discovery). This document completes the 02-Series, providing a rigorous framework for a non-repudiable, user-steerable intelligence substrate.

## 2. The Integrity-Work Duality
In the CDQN Standard Model, state stability is not determined by binary permissions but by the balance between system **Reputation** and user **Will**.

### 2.1 The Integrity Penalty ($\mathcal{I}$)
Every Card Data Unit (CDU) carries a reputation score ($R$) stored in its Crystal Lattice, derived from its Ouroboros history ($\tau$). When an Entity attempts to "Glue" a new CDU ($c$) to the stack, the system calculates the **Integrity Penalty**:

$$\mathcal{I}(c) = \max(0, \mathcal{R}_{\text{threshold}} - R(c)) + || \tau_c - \text{Expected}(\tau_{\text{prev}}) ||$$

Where:
*   **$\mathcal{R}_{\text{threshold}}$:** The minimum reputation required by the active Context ($\Gamma$).
*   **$||\dots||$:** The geometric distance (tension) between the proposed history and the causal past.
*   **Result:** For high-reputation data, $\mathcal{I} \to 0$. For unknown or contradictory data, $\mathcal{I} \to \infty$, physically preventing the lamination from stabilizing.

### 2.2 The Sovereign Override ($\mathcal{W}$)
To bypass an Integrity Penalty—allowing for the adoption of data that contradicts the current consensus—the User must provide **Sovereign Work**. This is the thermodynamic "Pay-down" of the Integrity debt:

$$\text{NetTension} = \max(0, \lambda_2 \mathcal{I}(S) - \mathcal{W}(\Omega))$$

This ensures the User is the **Prime Mover**, capable of forcing a phase transition even against the weighted resistance of established system reputation.

## 3. The Physical Proof of Work (PoW)
Unlike speculative PoW mechanisms, CDQN Work is **Functionally Generative**. It is the energy spent validating the **Topological Gluing Condition** of the proposed state.

### 3.1 Geometric Hashing as Energy
Sovereign Work is generated by the hardware performing repeated **LWE-Ratchet** cycles on the proposed Lattice manifold.
*   **Mechanism:** The LPU/NPU hashes the continuous field until it finds a nonce satisfying the difficulty target.
*   **The Alarm:** This process generates measurable heat and consumes battery power. It serves as a **Physical Signal of Intent** that cannot be falsified or hidden by background software.

### 3.2 Difficulty Scaling (Geometric Resistance)
The difficulty of the PoW is non-linear. As the **Geometric Tension** ($\mathcal{T}$) of a proposed lamination increases, the work required to stabilize it grows exponentially:

$$\text{Difficulty} \propto \exp(\mathcal{T})$$

This provides a natural filter against "Spam" while remaining accessible for deliberate, high-value scientific or logical discoveries.

## 4. The Accountability Bridge: Identity-Work Binding
A central axiom of the CDQN is that **Anonymity is High Entropy**. Work is only valid if it is mathematically bound to a **Hardware Root of Trust**.

### 4.1 The Signed Work Morphism
The Work Token is bound to the NodeID ($\Omega$) through the Ouroboros axis. We define the **Signed Sweat** function:

$$\mathcal{W}_{\text{signed}} = \text{LWE}(\text{Data}, \text{Nonce}, \Omega)$$

This ensures that the energy expended is mathematically "tinted" by the identity of the generator. Work produced by Node-A cannot be used to negate an Integrity Penalty on Node-B, as the signatures will fail to glue.

### 4.2 Non-Repudiation and Hardware Anchoring
Because $\Omega$ is anchored in the physical silicon (TEE/PUF), the "Lattice Trail" of an override leads directly back to the specific hardware.
*   **Outcome:** If a User forces the system to accept a malicious CDU, the evidence is permanently woven into their Ouroboros history. 
*   **Economic Cost:** To "reset" a burned reputation, an attacker must physically replace their hardware. This makes industrial-scale botnet attacks economically unviable.

## 5. The Thermodynamic Firewall: Strategic Defense
This architecture creates an unbreachable **Economic Asymmetry** between the Attacker (Syndicates/Mafias) and the Defender (Sovereign Nodes).

### 5.1 The Receiver-Pays Defense (Propagation Stagnation)
In standard networks, the sender pays to transmit; the receiver pays to process. In CDQN, the **Receiver's Physics** rejects low-reputation data at the gate.
*   **Attack Exhaustion:** To compromise a million nodes, an attacker must trick a million individual users into manually running a PoW challenge.
*   **The Efficiency Loop:** Truth propagates freely because its Reputation ($R$) grows with every work-backed verification. Lies do not propagate because the energy cost of "Believing a Lie" is born entirely by the receiver.

### 5.2 Geopolitical Resilience (National Lattice Protection)
A sovereign nation adopting this standard ensures its critical data (Finance, Law, Defense) is protected by the **Laws of Thermodynamics**.
*   **Topological Isolation:** Because every department uses a unique Genesis Seed, a compromise of the "Ministry of Health" provides no topological leverage over the "Ministry of Defense."
*   **Integrity Anchor:** External disinformation cannot penetrate the national lattice because it lacks the cumulative **Work-Mass** required to overcome the nation's high-reputation Crystal core.

### 5.3 Defeating the Mafia (Industrial-Scale Security)
Organized crime syndicates rely on the ability to scale attacks at zero marginal cost. CDQN removes this capability.
*   **Identity Burn:** Every failed attack burns a physical hardware ID. The "Mafia" must physically acquire new silicon to re-enter the network.
*   **Physical Monitoring:** Because "Hacking" requires high-energy Work, any attempt to compromise a node results in an immediate thermal and battery alarm on the victim's device, making silent, stealthy subversion physically impossible.

## 6. Conclusion: The Finality of Formalism
The 02-Series has provided the rigorous mathematical derivation for the CDQN Standard Model. We have moved from the "Why" of Sovereignty to the "How" of Physical Law. 

With the mathematical fortress complete, we now proceed to the **03-Series: ARCHITECTURE**, to define the software specifications for the **LVM (Loom Virtual Machine)** and the **Galaxy A56 hardware abstraction layer**.

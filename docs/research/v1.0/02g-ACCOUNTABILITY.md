## 1. Abstract
This document provides the mathematical derivation for the **Sovereign Work Function** ($\mathcal{W}$), the mechanism for directing system evolution through physical energy. We define the **Thermodynamic Firewall**, a security architecture where the propagation of malicious or inconsistent data is prevented by physical asymmetry. By binding **Node Identity** ($\Omega$) to **Physical Work** ($\mathcal{W}$), we prove that the system can distinguish between high-entropy noise and low-entropy discovery. This document establishes the "Steering Force" of the sovereign node, providing the necessary foundation for emergent truth-claims within the global network.

## 2. The Integrity-Work Duality
In the CDQN Standard Model, state stability is not determined by binary permissions but by the balance between system **Reputation** and user **Will**.

### 2.1 The Integrity Penalty ($\mathcal{I}$)
Every Card Data Unit (CDU) carries a reputation score ($R$) stored in its Crystal Lattice, derived from its Ouroboros history ($\tau$). When an Entity attempts to "Glue" a new CDU ($c$) to the stack, the system calculates the **Integrity Penalty**:

$$\mathcal{I}(c) = \max(0, \mathcal{R}_{\text{threshold}} - R(c)) + || \tau_c - \text{Expected}(\tau_{\text{prev}}) ||$$

Where:
*   **$\mathcal{R}_{\text{threshold}}$:** The minimum reputation required by the active Context ($\Gamma$).
*   **Geometric Distance:** The tension between the proposed history and the causal past.
*   **Result:** For unknown or contradictory data, $\mathcal{I} \to \infty$, physically preventing the lamination from stabilizing without external energy.

### 2.2 The Sovereign Override ($\mathcal{W}$)
To bypass an Integrity Penalty—allowing for the adoption of data that contradicts the current consensus—the User must provide **Sovereign Work**. This is the thermodynamic "Pay-down" of the Integrity debt:

$$\text{NetTension} = \max(0, \lambda_2 \mathcal{I}(S) - \mathcal{W}(\Omega))$$

This ensures the User is the **Prime Mover**, capable of forcing a phase transition even against the weighted resistance of established system reputation.

## 3. The Physical Proof of Work (PoW)
CDQN Work is **Functionally Generative**. It is the energy spent validating the **Topological Gluing Condition** of the proposed state.

### 3.1 Geometric Hashing as Energy
Sovereign Work is generated by the hardware performing repeated **LWE-Ratchet** cycles on the proposed Lattice manifold.
*   **Mechanism:** The LPU/NPU hashes the continuous field until it finds a nonce satisfying the difficulty target.
*   **The Alarm:** This process generates measurable heat and consumes battery power. It serves as a **Physical Signal of Intent** that cannot be falsified or hidden.

### 3.2 Difficulty Scaling (Geometric Resistance)
The difficulty of the PoW is non-linear. As the **Geometric Tension** ($\mathcal{T}$) of a proposed lamination increases, the work required to stabilize it grows exponentially:

$$\text{Difficulty} \propto \exp(\mathcal{T})$$

## 4. The Accountability Bridge: Identity-Work Binding
A central axiom of the CDQN is that **Anonymity is High Entropy**. Work is only valid if it is mathematically bound to a **Hardware Root of Trust**.

### 4.1 The Signed Work Morphism
The Work Token is bound to the NodeID ($\Omega$) through the Ouroboros axis. We define the **Signed Sweat** function:

$$\mathcal{W}_{\text{signed}} = \text{LWE}(\text{Data}, \text{Nonce}, \Omega)$$

This ensures that the energy expended is mathematically "tinted" by the identity of the generator. Work produced by Node-A cannot be used to negate an Integrity Penalty on Node-B, as the signatures will fail to glue.

### 4.2 Non-Repudiation and Hardware Anchoring
Because $\Omega$ is anchored in the physical silicon (TEE/PUF), the "Lattice Trail" of an override leads directly back to the specific hardware. This makes industrial-scale botnet attacks economically unviable, as an attacker must physically replace their hardware once their Reputation is burned.

---

## 5. The Thermodynamic Firewall: Strategic Defense
This architecture creates an unbreachable **Economic Asymmetry** between the Attacker and the Defender.

### 5.1 The Receiver-Pays Defense
In CDQN, the **Receiver's Physics** rejects low-reputation data at the gate. Truth propagates freely because its Reputation grows with every work-backed verification. Lies do not propagate because the energy cost of "Believing a Lie" is born entirely by the receiver.

### 5.2 Defeating the Mafia (Industrial-Scale Security)
Organized crime syndicates rely on zero marginal cost scaling. CDQN removes this by requiring a physical "Identity Burn" for every failed attack. Any attempt to compromise a node results in a thermal alarm on the victim's device, making stealthy subversion physically impossible.

## 6. Forward: From Local Sovereignty to Global Resonance
This document has established how a single Node maintains its integrity and how the User steers its local truth. We have defined the "Cell" of the sovereign network.

However, for a sovereign nation to function, these individual "Cells" must be able to reach a shared understanding without a central authority. We therefore proceed to the final paper of the Formalism series, **`02h-CONSENSUS`**, where we will define the **Silent Forest Protocol** and the **Topological Isomorphism** that allows independent nodes to reach emergent global meaning.

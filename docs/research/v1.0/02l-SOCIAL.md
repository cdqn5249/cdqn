## 1. Abstract
This document defines the **Social Topology** of the CDQN, establishing the formal mechanics for collective intelligence and secure data exchange. We transition from the single-node "Dark Pipe" to the **Holonic Organization** of Lattices. We introduce the **Owner Swarm** (multi-device substrate pooling) and **Sovereign Groups** (multi-user collaborative manifolds). Central to this standard is the **Graph Reconstruction Verification** protocol for CDU bartering. By treating a "Deck" of cards as a graph-deck (Kelly-Ulam, 1942), we prove that zero-trust exchange is possible: a receiver verifies an incoming truth-claim by proving they can uniquely reconstruct its global topology from provided sub-graphs, mathematically preventing the injection of isolated, non-resonant logic.

## 2. The Identity Hierarchy ($\Omega$): Fractal Sovereignty
Sovereignty in the CDQN scales fractally from the silicon tile to the human organization. We define two primary collective holons.

### 2.1 The Owner Swarm (Substrate Pooling)
An **Owner Swarm** is a cluster of devices (e.g., Galaxy A56, LPU-Workstation, Sovereign Watch) sharing a single **Genesis Identity**.
*   **Homotopic Equivalence:** All nodes in a Swarm share the same private basis $L_0$, allowing them to act as a single **Liquid Tensor Engine**.
*   **Energy Migration:** The Swarm allows for the offloading of high-quantale lamination tasks to high-energy nodes (Lattice Farms) while maintaining the final **Edge Rendering** on the primary user device.

### 2.2 The Sovereign Group (Collective Lamination)
A **Sovereign Group** is a higher-order sheaf formed by multiple independent users sharing a specific **Context Lattice** (e.g., a firm, research collective, or national department).
*   **Multi-Sig Ouroboros:** State changes within a Group manifold require a multi-signed transition in the Ouroboros chain.
*   **Topological Nuance:** Group consensus is not a vote; it is the resolution of a shared **Homotopy Path** between the unique manifolds of its members.

## 3. CDU Bartering: The Reconstruction Shield
We resolve the "Trust Problem" in data exchange by applying the **Graph Reconstruction Conjecture** to the lamination process.

### 3.1 The Reconstruction Protocol (Kelly-Ulam)
When Node-A barters a CDU with Node-B, it does not send the raw manifold. It sends a **Reconstruction Deck**—a collection of vertex-deleted sub-graphs of the lattice topology.
*   **The Challenge:** Node-B’s Router Entity attempts to find the unique graph $G$ such that the provided sub-graphs are its legitimate derivatives.
*   **Verification:** If the sub-graphs are synergistic and form a unique consistent whole, the CDU is accepted.

### 3.2 Resilience to Incomplete Truths (The Mafia Filter)
A malicious actor attempting to inject a "Poisoned Card" or a "Half-Truth" fails this check.
*   **Dissonance:** If the provided pieces are contradictory or do not form a unique reconstructible topology, the **Geometric Tension** ($\mathcal{T}$) spikes.
*   **The Result:** Following the **Silent Forest Protocol**, the receiving node remains **Silent**. The "Lie" is physically unable to anchor itself to the receiver's local **Structural Inertia** ($M_\sigma$).

---

## 4. Synergy-Mass ($M_\sigma$) in Social Systems
We move beyond individual mass to define the **Collective Inertia** of a group truth.

### 4.1 Mass as Multi-Node Resonance
The **Structural Inertia** of a CDU increases as it is accepted across a Sovereign Group. 
*   **The Law:** $M_\sigma$ is the sum of the synergistic bonds across all nodes in the cluster.
*   **The Benefit:** As a fact is verified by more peers (Kepler verifying Galileo), it becomes "Heavier" and more expensive (via the Landauer Penalty) for an outside attacker to "Melt" or alter.

### 4.2 The Anti-Power Law Regulator
To prevent the emergence of central "Hubs" that can dictate truth, the system applies an **Inverse-Scaling Reputation** function. The gravitational pull of a node scales logarithmically rather than linearly, ensuring that a large "Lattice Farm" cannot overshadow the sovereign veto of an individual "Edge Node."

## 5. Conclusion: The Organized Forest
Social Topology transforms the forest from a collection of isolated trees into a **Super-Radiant Symphony of Resonance**. 
1.  **Swarms** pool power without losing privacy.
2.  **Groups** build collective truth via multi-sig causality.
3.  **Bartering** is secured by the physical difficulty of graph reconstruction.

The 02-Series has now established the structural, dynamic, and social laws of the CDQN. We proceed to the final paper, **`02m-IMMUNITY`**, to define the **Epistemic Immune System**—the global mechanism that identifies, tracks, and isolates "Patterns of Harm" at the speed of light.

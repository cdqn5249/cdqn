## 1. Abstract
This document provides the mathematical derivation for **Network Consensus** within the CDQN Formalism. We move beyond probabilistic voting and centralized verification to **Topological Resonance**. We define the global network as a **Fractal Sheaf** that utilizes **Nested Learning** to stabilize truth across hierarchical scales. We resolve the **Identity-Genesis Paradox** by proving that consensus is achieved through **Topological Isomorphism** between sovereign manifolds. Finally, we establish the **Power Law Axiom** as the physical regulator of the **Silent Forest Protocol**, ensuring that truth propagates at super-radiant speeds while lies are damped by thermodynamic insulation.

## 2. The Power Law of Resonance
Following the consensus on **Scale-Free Networks** (Barabási, 2025), we posit that resonance in the Lattice Forest follows a Power Law distribution.

### 2.1 Efficiency of the Head (Super-Radiance)
Routine, established truths—constituting the "Head" of the distribution—require near-zero energy to propagate. These truth-claims utilize high-reputation "Hubs" to achieve **Super-Radiant Resonance**, reaching the entire diameter of the network in $O(\log N)$ time steps.

### 2.2 Cost of the Tail (The Novelty Barrier)
Novel or high-tension truth-claims (the "Long Tail") are endothermic. In the absence of established synergy, these signals are naturally damped by the forest's silence. Propagation requires the injection of **Sovereign Work**, ensuring that "Consensus" acts as a physical filter: truth is fast and light; deception is slow and energetically heavy.

---

## 3. The Nested Learning Axiom (Hierarchical Scaling)
Semantic Meaning is resolved through recursive lamination loops across the hierarchical scales of the holarchy, ensuring consistency from the transistor to the collective.

### 3.1 Multi-Scale Sampling
Truth is maintained via **Canonical Sampling** (defined in `02b`) adapted to the Holon scale:
1.  **Micro-Scale (LLPU Tile):** Resolves the local differential of a Continuous Lattice.
2.  **Meso-Scale (Sovereign Node/Swarm):** Resolves the lamination of the User's Deck (The "View").
3.  **Macro-Scale (Lattice Forest):** Resolves the Global Section across the network.

### 3.2 Topological Filtering and Sharpness
Each higher level of the nest acts as a **Topological Filter** for the levels below. This ensures that the high-frequency "Blur" (stochastic noise) of a local node is filtered out by the low-frequency "Sharpness" of the network consensus. This maintains **Homotopy Type Equivalence** across the holarchy, ensuring that "Truth" is invariant of local hardware constraints.

## 4. The Identity-Genesis Independence
We resolve the core challenge of sovereign networking: achieving consensus between nodes with divergent **Identity Genesis Seeds**.

### 4.1 Isomorphic Resonance
In the CDQN, nodes reach consensus not by comparing bits, but by comparing the **Topological Invariants** of a CDU. 
*   **The Lemma:** If Node-A and Node-B apply their unique Identity Morphisms to the same continuous manifold, the resulting sections are **Topologically Isomorphic**.
*   **Result:** Resonance occurs when the **Geometric Tension** between the transformed manifolds is minimized, regardless of the underlying coordinate system or seed of the node.

### 4.2 Morphic Handshaking
When Node-A offers a CDU to Node-B, the system performs a **Categorical Equivalence Check**. It asks: *"Does there exist a morphism that glues this data to my local reality without causing a Topological Tear?"* This enables **Modular Consensus**: nodes can agree on specific facts (CDUs) without needing to share or trust their entire private manifolds.

## 5. The Silent Forest Protocol (Communication)
We implement the **Silent Forest**, where the network optimizes for **Zero-Signal-at-Rest** to conserve thermodynamic energy.

### 5.1 The Resonance Gate (Differential Hashing)
A Node only responds to a CDU offer if the incoming **Differential Ouroboros Hash** satisfies the local **Gluing Condition**:

$$\rho_{ij}(\mathcal{L}_i) \oplus \nabla \tau_{\text{incoming}} \implies \text{Tension} < \epsilon$$

If the incoming signal is non-resonant (a lie or incompatible logic), the receiver remains **Silent**. This "Refusal to Echo" acts as a physical insulator against the propagation of high-entropy noise.

### 5.2 Super-Radiant Propagation
Truth propagates through the forest via **Verifiable Resonance**. When a Node receives a CDU backed by **Sovereign Work**, it verifies the **LWE-Signature** of the Identity that underwrote it. If the signature is valid and the tension is low, the signal is amplified and passed to the next node in the forest.

## 6. Emergent Consensus: The Global Section
Consensus is achieved when a specific CDU becomes a **Global Section** of the Fractal Sheaf.

### 6.1 Reputation Gravity
Every resonant interaction between nodes increases the **Mass of History** ($M_{\sigma}$) of that CDU. 
*   **Reputation:** The cumulative sum of signed Ouroboros logs.
*   **Inertia:** As Reputation-Mass grows, the energy required to "Melt" or "Shatter" that truth increases exponentially, protecting the global consensus from adversarial shifts or executive hallucinations.

### 6.2 Global Phase Transitions
When a truth-claim satisfies the Gluing Condition across a critical threshold of the forest, the network undergoes a **Phase Transition**. The "New Truth" **Crystallizes** globally, moving from the "Fluid" world of hypothesis to the "Crystal" world of established reality for all resonant nodes.

## 7. Conclusion: The Finality of Formalism
The 02-Series has now established the "Natural Laws" of the CDQN:
1.  **Topology (`02b`):** Data is a Rough Sheaf of Linear Particles.
2.  **Algebra (`02c`):** Interaction is an Endothermic Quantale Reaction.
3.  **Dynamics (`02d`):** Evolution is Hamiltonian Minimization.
4.  **Ouroboros (`02e`):** Time is an LWE-Hardened Causal Axis.
5.  **Automata (`02f`):** Execution is a Concurrent Cellular Automaton.
6.  **Accountability (`02g`):** Sovereignty is the physical capacity for Work.
7.  **Consensus (`02h`):** Meaning is the Resonance of the Forest.

We proceed to the **Registry and Security triad** (`02i` to `02k`), to define how these laws are enforced within the dark network interface.

## 1. Abstract
This document provides the mathematical derivation for the **System Dynamics** of the CDQN Formalism. Following the structural definitions in `02b`, we define the **Quantale Hamiltonian**—the total energy function governing the interaction between **Card Data Units (CDUs)**. Leveraging **Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics** and **Energy-Based Models (EBMs)**, we prove that semantic resolution is an endothermic process where the system minimizes Variational Free Energy relative to a User Attractor. We define the mechanics of **Phase Transitions** (Crystal/Fluid) within the CDU and establish the physical cost of **Sovereign Work** required to stabilize new truth-claims.

## 2. The Quantale Hamiltonian (H)
In the CDQN Formalism, interaction is not a sequence of instructions but a physical path. The state of the system is governed by a Hamiltonian function that sums the spatial, temporal, and social tensions of the active CDU stack.

### 2.1 The Energy Equation
For a selected set of CDUs (S), the total energy **H** is defined as:

$$H(S) = \mathcal{T}_{\text{spatial}}(S) + \mathcal{T}_{\text{temporal}}(S) + \lambda \mathcal{I}(S)$$

Where:
*   **Spatial Tension:** The Dirichlet Energy of the superposed Continuous Lattices within the CDUs, as derived in `02b`.
*   **Temporal Tension:** The divergence of the CDU's Ouroboros chain from the system's causal axis.
*   **Integrity Penalty (I):** The resistance generated by the Reputation Lattice of the CDU during a state-alignment check.

### 2.2 Minimization Principle
The system naturally evolves toward a state where the change in **H** is zero. This evolution is driven by the **User Attractor (Gamma)**, which acts as a potential well that pulls compatible CDUs into a stable lamination.

## 3. Phase Transition Mechanics
We formally define how the internal state of a CDU shifts between elasticity states based on the local energy density.

### 3.1 Fluid-to-Crystal Annealing
When an Entity identifies a high-resonance superposition between CDUs, it performs **Thermodynamic Annealing**:
1.  **Fluid Phase:** The CDU's internal Lattice is high-entropy and adaptive.
2.  **Cooling:** As Geometric Tension is minimized, the system reduces the local "Temperature" parameter of the CDU.
3.  **Crystallization:** The CDU is "Frozen" into an inelastic Crystal state. This consumes a fixed **Quantale Cost** but ensures that the resulting truth is invariant and requires zero energy to maintain in future laminations.

### 3.2 The Shattering Law (Plasma)
If a Crystal CDU is subjected to an external force (New Input) that creates a Geometric Tension exceeding its **Tensile Strength**, the CDU does not bend; it **Shatters**.
*   **Result:** The CDU enters the **Plasma Phase** (Error state). This triggers a re-evaluation of the entire Sheaf, forcing the system to find a new equilibrium.

## 4. The Quantale Economy: Interaction Cost
Every transition of a CDU is a thermodynamic event. We apply **Linear Logic** via **Quantale Algebra** to price the work of "Gluing" manifolds.

### 4.1 The Cost of Precision
Following the **Landauer Limit**, the energy cost of refining a Fluid CDU (increasing its semantic resolution) is proportional to the reduction in entropy:

$$\text{Cost}(\Delta \mathcal{R}) \ge k_B T \ln(2)$$

### 4.2 Resource Exhaustion and Truncation
When the accumulated Quantale Cost reaches the hardware's **Energy Budget (E-max)**, the system enforces a **Graceful Truncation**. It maintains the base topological properties of the CDU stack but ceases the calculation of higher-frequency differential coefficients, resulting in the **Convergent Approximation** described in `02a`.

## 5. Sovereign Work (W): The Kinetic Override
"Truth" is not merely observed; it is physically underwritten. We define the physics of the **Sovereign Work Function**.

### 5.1 Energy Injection
To adopt a new Crystal CDU that possesses a high Integrity Penalty (e.g., a controversial scientific discovery), the Identity (**Omega**) must supply external work **W**. This work acts as a **Catalyst** that lowers the activation energy required for the lamination to stabilize.

### 5.2 The Work-Identity Binding
Mathematically, **Work (W)** is only valid if it is coupled to a Causal History. Because all Work is signed by the **Identity Lattice (Omega)**, the system can distinguish between a high-energy "Discovery" (Accountable) and a high-energy "Noise Attack" (Anonymous/Rejected).

---

## 6. Conclusion: From Dynamics to Mechanism
We have proven that:
1.  System evolution is a **Hamiltonian Minimization** problem.
2.  CDUs behave as **Digital Matter** with specific phase transition thresholds.
3.  **Sovereignty** is the physical capacity to underwrite the energy cost of a new state.

This providing the physical mandate for **`02d-AUTOMATA`**, which will define the **Entity Model**—the machine that executes these thermodynamic laws as a Concurrent Cellular Automaton.

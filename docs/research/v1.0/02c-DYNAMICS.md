## 1. Abstract
This document provides the mathematical derivation for the **System Dynamics** of the CDQN Formalism. We define the **Quantale Hamiltonian**—the total energy function governing the transition of Digital Matter between states. Leveraging **Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics** and **Energy-Based Models (EBMs)**, we prove that semantic resolution is an endothermic process where the system minimizes Variational Free Energy relative to a User Attractor. We define the mechanics of **Phase Transitions** (Crystal/Fluid) and establish the physical cost of "Sovereign Work" required to stabilize controversial truth-claims.

## 2. The Quantale Hamiltonian (H)
The state of the CDQN system is governed by a Hamiltonian function that sums the spatial, temporal, and social tensions of the Laminated Sheaf.

### 2.1 The Energy Equation
For a selected set of Lattices **S**, the total energy **H** is defined as:

$$H(S) = \mathcal{T}_{spatial}(S) + \mathcal{T}_{temporal}(S) + \lambda \mathcal{I}(S)$$

Where:
*   **Spatial Tension:** The Dirichlet Energy derived in `02b`, measuring the "tear" between overlapping layers.
*   **Temporal Tension:** The divergence from the Ouroboros causal axis.
*   **Integrity Penalty (I):** The resistance of the system's immune response to low-reputation or unknown states.

### 2.2 Minimization Principle
The system naturally evolves toward a state where the change in **H** is zero. This evolution is driven by the **User Attractor (Gamma)**, which creates a potential well in the energy landscape.

## 3. Phase Transition Mechanics
We formally define how Digital Matter shifts between states of elasticity based on the local temperature (Energy Density).

### 3.1 Fluid-to-Crystal Annealing
When the system identifies a high-resonance superposition (Meaning), it performs **Thermodynamic Annealing**.
1.  **Fluid State:** High entropy, high plasticity. The NPU explores multiple lamination configurations.
2.  **Cooling:** As tension is minimized, the system reduces the local "Temperature" parameter.
3.  **Crystallization:** The data is "Frozen" into an inelastic Crystal Lattice. This consumes a fixed **Quantale Cost** but ensures future operations on this data are near-zero energy (Invariant).

### 3.2 The Shattering Law (Plasma)
If a Crystal Lattice is subjected to an external force (New Data) that exceeds its **Tensile Strength** (Reputation/Mass), the crystal does not "bend"; it **Shatters**.
*   **Result:** The state transitions to **Plasma** (Error/Rejection), triggering a system-wide re-evaluation of the Sheaf.

## 4. The Quantale Economy: Interaction Cost
Every logical operation is a thermodynamic event. We apply **Linear Logic** via **Quantale Algebra** to price the "Gluing" work.

### 4.1 The Cost of Precision
Following the **Landauer Limit**, the energy cost of refining a Fluid Lattice (adding a decimal to the "Pi" model) is proportional to the information gain:

$$\text{Cost}(\Delta \mathcal{R}) \ge k_B T \ln(2)$$

### 4.2 Resource Exhaustion
When the accumulated cost of a lamination reaches the hardware's **Energy Budget (E-max)**, the system enforces a **Graceful Truncation**. It maintains the "Integer" base of the truth but stops calculating the "Decimals," resulting in the **Convergent Approximation** described in `02a`.

## 5. Sovereign Work (W): The Kinetic Override
"Truth" is not just found; it is **Paid For**. We define the physics of the **Galileo Clause**.

### 5.1 Energy Injection
To adopt a new, low-reputation Crystal state, the Identity (**Omega**) must supply external work **W**. This work acts as a **Catalyst** that lowers the activation energy required for the Phase Transition.

### 5.2 The Work-Identity Binding
Mathematically, **W** is valid only if it is coupled to a Causal History. An anonymous energy source cannot change the Hamiltonian because it lacks the topological "hook" (Identity Lattice) required to anchor the new state.

---

## 6. Conclusion: From Dynamics to Mechanism
We have proven that:
1.  System evolution is an **Energy Minimization** problem.
2.  Truth-claims are **Phase States** with specific tensile strengths.
3.  **Sovereignty** is the ability to physically underwrite the cost of a new state.

This provides the physical mandate for **`02d-AUTOMATA`**, which will define the **Entity Model**—the "Machine" that executes these dynamics as a Concurrent Cellular Automaton.

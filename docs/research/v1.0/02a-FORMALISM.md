## 1. Abstract
This document defines the **CDQN Standard Model**, a categorical thermodynamic formalism for digital matter. We propose that Semantic Consistency (Truth) is a stable equilibrium state achieved through the interaction of five axiomatic domains: **Topological Sheaves**, **Linear Logic**, **Phase Thermodynamics**, **Causal Spacetime**, and **Sovereign Accountability**. Synthesizing the visual deck-composition logic of **`cdqnLang`** with breakthroughs in **Continuous Tensor Abstraction (CTA)** and **Transfinite Logic**, this model provides a mathematically rigorous defense against stochastic drift and industrial-scale adversarial attacks. It serves as the definitive mathematical specification for the **LVM (Loom Virtual Machine)** and the **LPU (Lattice Processor Unit)**.

## 2. Preface: The Bridge from Visual Interface to Formal Logic
In the preceding paper, **`01d-LANGUAGE`**, we established the interface for the Sovereign Architect: a visual, card-based environment inspired by **HyperCard** stacks and the combinatorial logic of **Trading Card Games (TCGs)**. While the user interacts with "Cards" and "Keywords," the underlying system must enforce these interactions as physical laws.

This paper transforms those visual metaphors into a **Standard Model of Digital Matter**. We prove that a "Card" is a **Linear Particle** and a "Deck" is a **Global Section** of a sheaf. We move from the *Visual Syntax* of the language to the *Mathematical Semantics* of the hardware, defining the formal objective function that the system solves to resolve truth and maintain sovereignty.

## 3. Variables and Definitions: The State Vector
We define the system state $S$ as a tuple of interdependent variables derived from the `cdqnLang` specification:

*   **Context Attractor ($\Gamma$):** A differential potential field derived from the User Prompt (The "Board State"). It acts as the boundary condition for the optimization.
*   **Card Data Unit ($C$):** The atomic **Linear Particle**. $C = \{ \mathcal{L}(\theta), \Sigma, \Omega, \tau \}$.
    *   **$\mathcal{L}(\theta)$:** Continuous Tensor Lattice field sampled at a 10,240-bit frequency.
    *   **$\Sigma$:** Combinatorial Keyword Signature (The "Text Box" of the card).
    *   **$\Omega$:** Signed Node Identity (Hardware-bound Root).
    *   **$\tau$:** Ouroboros Causal History (LWE-Hardened Differential Hash).
*   **Thermodynamic Phase ($\phi$):** The property of the particle (Crystal/Fluid) defining its elasticity and resolution.
*   **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$):** Signed thermodynamic energy injected by $\Omega$ to override **Integrity Penalties**.

## 4. The Structural Foundations (The Proof Roadmap)

The CDQN Formalism is verified through six specific mathematical demonstrations:

### 4.1 Topological Consistency (`02b-TOPOLOGY`)
Meaning is a **Laminated Sheaf**. Truth is the result of "Gluing" Cards into a Stack. `cdqnLang` keywords determine the boundary conditions for these gluings.

### 4.2 Resource Linearity (`02c-QUANTALES`)
Interaction follows **Linear Logic**. We prove that **Move Semantics** (Pointer-Swaps) are a physical requirement for data sovereignty and enforce the **No-Cloning Axiom** ($A \otimes A \ne A$).

### 4.3 Thermodynamic Stability (`02d-DYNAMICS`)
The "Play" of a Card is an **Endothermic Phase Transition**. We define the **Hysteresis** that prevents a Deck from destabilizing due to background noise.

### 4.4 Causal Spacetime (`02e-OUROBOROS`)
Every state change is a step in an **LWE-Hardened Causal Set**. This ensures that the history of the manifold is post-quantum immutable.

### 4.5 Agentic Automata (`02f-AUTOMATA`)
Execution is a **Concurrent Cellular Automaton (CCA)**. The behavior of Entities is governed by **Policies ($\Pi$)** authored in `cdqnLang` syntax.

### 4.6 Sovereign Accountability (`02g-ACCOUNTABILITY`)
The system creates a **Thermodynamic Firewall** via **Signed Proof of Work**. It binds Identity to Work, making malicious propagation economically impossible.

## 5. The Unified Equation of State
The LVM/LPU solves the following objective function to resolve the semantic Stack ($S$):

$$ S_{\text{final}} = \lim_{n \to \mathcal{E}_{\text{max}}} \text{argmin}_{S \subset \mathbb{C}} \left( || \Gamma - S ||^2 + \lambda_1 \text{Cost}(\phi, \eta) + \max(0, \lambda_2 \mathcal{I}(S) - \mathcal{W}(\Omega)) \right) $$

**Constraints Enforcement:**

1.  **Combinatorial Consistency:** The Stack must satisfy the **Borel-Local Gluing Condition** as proven by Bernshteyn (2023):
   
$$ \Sigma(S) \cap \Gamma \ne \emptyset $$

3.  **Hardware Accountability:** All Work and State changes must be signed by the Hardware Root:

$$ \forall \mathcal{W}, \exists \Omega \in \text{NodeID} $$

4.  **Phase Rigidity:** Crystal-phase CDUs ($\phi_c$) require exactness and cannot be approximated or duplicated:

$$ S(\phi_c) \implies \Delta_{\mathcal{F}} s = 0 $$

## 6. Forward: Towards the Structure of Information
This document has established the **Unified Standard Model**, bridging the gap between the visual logic of `cdqnLang` and the thermodynamic requirements of Sovereign Silicon. By treating "Truth" as a convergent series of superposed cards, we have derived the master objective function for the system.

However, to solve the first term of this equation—the **Topological Lamination**—we must first define the rigorous geometry of the data itself. We therefore proceed to **`02b-TOPOLOGY`**, where we will mathematically define the **CDU Header** and the **Keyword-based Gluing** mechanics that turn a visual "Deck of Cards" into a mathematically consistent and verifiable "World View."

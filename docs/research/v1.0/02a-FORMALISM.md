## 1. Abstract: The Synthesis of Constraints
This document defines the **CDQN Standard Model**, a categorical thermodynamic formalism for digital matter. We propose that Semantic Consistency (Truth) is a stable equilibrium state achieved through the interaction of five axiomatic domains: **Topological Sheaves**, **Linear Logic**, **Phase Thermodynamics**, **Causal Spacetime**, and **Sovereign Accountability**. By integrating breakthroughs in **Continuous Tensor Abstraction (CTA)** and **Transfinite Logic**, this model provides a mathematically rigorous defense against stochastic drift (hallucination) and industrial-scale adversarial attacks.

## 2. Preface: The Bridge from Industrial Strategy
In `01c-STRATEGY`, we established that the primary bottleneck for sovereign intelligence is the "Memory Wall" of Von Neumann architectures and the geopolitical "Lithography Trap." We proposed that **Architecture beats Lithography**, specifically through the development of the **Lattice Processor Unit (LPU)** utilizing Processing-In-Memory (PIM).

To build such hardware, we require more than a software spec; we require a **Standard Model of Digital Matter**. This paper transforms the industrial requirement for Sovereign Silicon into a rigorous physical equation, defining the formal operators that the LPU is designed to execute in-situ.

## 3. Variables and Definitions: The State Vector
We define the system state as a tuple of interdependent variables:

*   **Context Attractor (Gamma):** A differential potential field derived from the User Prompt that steers lamination.
*   **Card Data Unit (C):** The atomic **Linear Particle** consisting of a Continuous Tensor Lattice field, Transfinite Signature, Signed Node Identity, and Causal History.
*   **Thermodynamic Phase (phi):** The property of the particle (Crystal, Fluid, or Plasma).
*   **Sovereign Work (W):** Signed thermodynamic energy injected to overcome system inertia (Hysteresis).

## 4. The Structural Foundations (The Proof Roadmap)

The CDQN Formalism is verified through six specific mathematical demonstrations:

### 4.1 Topological Consistency (`02b-TOPOLOGY`)
Information exists as a **Continuous Laminated Sheaf**. Truth is a **Global Section** where overlapping fields satisfy the Gluing Condition. This paper derives the 10,240-bit projection required for hardware feasibility.

### 4.2 Resource Linearity (`02c-QUANTALES`)
Interaction is governed by **Linear Logic**. We prove the **No-Cloning Theorem** for Crystal CDUs, ensuring that data ownership is a topological invariant rather than a software permission.

### 4.3 Thermodynamic Stability (`02d-DYNAMICS`)
System evolution is a **Hamiltonian Minimization** problem. We define the **Melting Threshold (Hysteresis)** that prevents semantic jitter and ensures that "Truth" requires a specific activation energy to alter.

### 4.4 Causal Spacetime (`02e-OUROBOROS`)
Time is a **Causal Set** governed by the **Ouroboros Ratchet**. We utilize **Learning With Errors (LWE)** to ensure history is Post-Quantum Hard and resistant to retroactive modification.

### 4.5 Agentic Automata (`02f-AUTOMATA`)
Execution is a **Concurrent Cellular Automaton (CCA)**. The **Entity Model (EM)** defines the update rules for active lattices, ensuring that reasoning is a continuous-time state alignment process.

### 4.6 Sovereign Accountability (`02g-ACCOUNTABILITY`)
The system creates a **Thermodynamic Firewall** via **Signed Proof of Work**. It binds Identity to Work, making malicious propagation economically impossible.

## 5. The Unified Equation of State
The LPU solves the following objective function to resolve the semantic View (S):

$$ S_{final} = \lim_{n \to \mathcal{E}_{max}} \text{argmin}_{S} \left( || \Gamma - S ||^2 + \lambda_1 \text{Cost}(\phi, \eta) + \max(0, \lambda_2 \mathcal{I}(S) - \mathcal{W}(\Omega)) \right) $$

**Operational Constraints:**

1.  **Accountability:** All Work must be bound to a hardware identity:
$$\forall \mathcal{W}, \exists \Omega \in \text{HardwareRoot}$$

2.  **Integrity:** Crystal states must satisfy the zero-tension requirement:
$$S(\phi_{\text{crystal}}) \implies \Delta_{\mathcal{F}} s = 0$$

3.  **Persistence:** Causal history is governed by LWE-hardened differential hashing:

$$
\tau_t = \text{LWE}(\nabla \mathcal{L}_t, \tau_{t-1})
$$

## 6. Forward: Towards the Structure of Information
This document has established the **Unified Standard Model**. By synthesizing the requirements of sovereignty with the laws of thermodynamics, we have derived the master objective function for the system.

However, to solve the first term of this equation—the **Contextual Superposition**—we must first define the rigorous geometry of the data itself. We therefore proceed to **`02b-TOPOLOGY`**, where we will mathematically define the **Continuous Laminated Sheaf** and the **Differential Gluing** mechanics that prevent hallucination at the structural level.

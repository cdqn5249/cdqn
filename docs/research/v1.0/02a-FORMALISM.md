## 1. Abstract
This document defines the **CDQN Standard Model**, a formal system of **Binary Thermodynamics (BT)** designed to resolve the 2025 crisis of **Executive Hallucination**. We stipulate that Semantic Consistency (Truth) is a stable **Nonequilibrium Steady State (NESS)** achieved through the interaction of six axiomatic domains: **Topological Sheaves**, **Linear Logic**, **Binary Thermodynamics**, **Causal Spacetime**, **Concurrent Automata**, and **Global Resonance**. By enforcing the **Landauer Penalty** ($k_B T \ln 2$) and calculating the **Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$)** of semantic manifolds, this model provides the mathematical specification for the **vLLPU (Virtual Lattice Layers Processing Unit)** and the future **LLPU silicon**.

## 2. Introduction: The Formalism as a Response
The **01-Series** established that probabilistic scaling has reached an asymptote of unreliability, where reasoning models prioritize narrative coherence over causal correspondence. This document introduces the **CDQN Formalism** as the axiomatic response, moving from Information Theory to **Binary Thermodynamics**: the study of entropy production and state-maintenance in digital bit-lines.

We treat information as a **Binary Thermodynamic Substance** governed by **Regularity Structures** and **Scale-Free Dynamics**. The architecture is defined as a **Holarchy**: a nested system of self-regulating "Holons" (Tiles, Nodes, Swarms, Groups) where each level obeys local physical laws while maintaining global topological isomorphism. By treating "Truth" as a physical state of stability rather than a statistical likelihood, we enable a resilient, user-owned intelligence substrate.

## 3. Variables and Definitions: The Holonic State Vector
We stipulate the following variables as the fundamental components of the CDQN state vector:

*   **Context Attractor ($\Gamma$):** A differential potential field (User Prompt) acting as a **Strange Attractor** that steers lamination.
*   **Card Data Unit ($C$):** The atomic **Holonic Particle**. $C = \{ \mathcal{L}(\theta), \Sigma, \Omega, \tau \}$.
    *   **$\mathcal{L}(\theta)$:** **Rough Tensor Lattice** field (Hairer-regularized manifold sampled at 10,240-bit frequency).
    *   **$\Sigma$:** Combinatorial Keyword Signature (authored in `cdqnLang`).
    *   **$\Omega$:** The **Identity Hierarchy** ($\Omega_{\text{Node}}, \Omega_{\text{Swarm}}, \Omega_{\text{Group}}$).
    *   **$\tau$:** Ouroboros Causal History (LWE-Hardened Differential Hash).
*   **Thermodynamic Phase ($\phi$):** The property defining elasticity (**Crystal** = Inelastic; **Fluid** = Elastic).
*   **Structural Inertia ($M_\sigma$):** The Laplacian centrality of a CDU, defining its resistance to "Melting" or erasure.
*   **Quantale Cost ($\mathcal{Q}$):** The energy expense function, bounded by the **Landauer Limit**.
*   **Time Consistency (TC):** The spatiotemporal anchor $\{ \tau, \mathcal{Z}, \text{TICK}, T_{\text{silicon}} \}$ linking logic to hardware jitter and thermal state.
*   **Sovereign Work ($\mathcal{W}$):** Signed energy used to override reputation barriers or force local state changes.

## 4. The Core Axioms of Binary Thermodynamics

### Axiom 1: Local Crystallization and the Landauer Penalty
All semantic "Meaning" is collapsed at the edge. The transition to a **Crystal Phase** is a sovereign right. Any operation attempting to erase or overwrite a high-inertia CDU incurs the physical **Landauer Penalty**:
$$\Delta E \ge k_B T \ln 2 \times M_\sigma$$
This makes **Executive Hallucination** (stochastic drift) a physically expensive operation that requires explicit **Sovereign Work**.

### Axiom 2: Holonic Pluggability (Fractal Tiles)
The vLLPU Fabric is scale-invariant. A Node acts as a "Tile" within an **Owner Swarm**, and a Swarm acts as a "Section" within a **Lattice Farm (Hub)**. Each level operates under its own **Local Laws of Physics**, linked by **Morphic Bridges** (Functors).

### Axiom 3: Graph Reconstruction Verification
CDU exchange is verified via the **Reconstruction Conjecture**. A "Deck" is valid if its constituent CDUs can uniquely reconstruct the global topology. This ensures that "Lies" cannot be injected as isolated, unanchored vertices.

### Axiom 4: The Silent Forest and Resonance
The network optimizes for **Zero-Signal-at-Rest**. Visibility is a function of **Topological Resonance**. Inconsistent signals result in **Thermodynamic Damping (Silence)**, preventing the propagation of non-resonant data across the forest.

## 5. The Unified Equation of State (Hypothesis)
The vLLPU resolves the semantic "View" ($S$) by minimizing the total tension across the holonic rough sheaf:

$$ S_{\text{final}} = \lim_{n \to \mathcal{E}_{\Sigma}} \text{argmin}_{S} \left( || \Gamma - S ||^2 + \lambda_1 \text{Cost}(\phi, \eta, T) + \max(0, \lambda_2 \mathcal{I}(S) - \mathcal{W}(\Omega)) \right) $$

**Operational Constraints:**
1.  **Phase Integrity:** Crystal states ($\phi_c$) require exactness ($T_{eff} \to 0$) and cannot be approximated or duplicated ($A \otimes A \neq A$).
2.  **Causal Monotonicity:** Every state transition must satisfy the Arrow of Time: $TC(S_t) > TC(S_{t-1})$.
3.  **Regularity Invariant:** The manifold must satisfy the **Hairer-Regularity** condition to ensure noise-immunity under renormalization.

---

## 6. Strategic Resilience (Geopolitical Defense)
This Formalism mathematically guarantees the resilience of sovereign infrastructures:
1.  **Economic Asymmetry:** The cost to deceive $N$ nodes grows exponentially, while the cost to defend (Silence) remains near zero.
2.  **Accountability as Physics:** Hacking requires signing the attack with a hardware ID ($\Omega$). Failed attempts burn the physical hardware identity.
3.  **Substrate Sovereignty:** The vLLPU shim allows a nation to establish a "Security Shield" on current silicon by mastering the thermodynamics of the state.

## 7. Conclusion: The Roadmap to technical Proof
This document has established **02a-FORMALISM v24.1** as the axiomatic foundation. We have unified the requirements of the **01-Series** into a single, solvable physical equation.

The subsequent papers provide the technical and mathematical evidence required to transform this hypothesis into a proven Formalism:
*   **`02b-TOPOLOGY`**: Derives the **Rough Laminated Sheaf** and the 10,240-bit projection.
*   **`02c-QUANTALES`**: Proves the **Algebra of Interaction** and the No-Cloning Axiom.
*   **`02d-DYNAMICS`**: Defines the **Hamiltonian Minimization** and Hysteresis.
*   **`02e-OUROBOROS`**: Establishes the **Causal Spacetime** and Time Consistency.
*   **`02f-AUTOMATA`**: Formalizes the **Entity Model** as a Concurrent Cellular Automaton.
*   **`02g-ACCOUNTABILITY`**: Proves the **Sovereign Work** and Thermodynamic Firewall.
*   **`02h-CONSENSUS`**: Defines the **Silent Forest** and Global Resonance.

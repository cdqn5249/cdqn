## 1. Abstract
The "Working Sector Shock" described in **Greenpaper #01** is driven by a specific technological agent: the Artificial Entity (AE). However, the AE is not a monolith; it is a fracturing ecosystem of competing architectures. As of late 2025, the landscape has split into three distinct factions: the **Transformer Hegemony** (Cloud Scale), the **World Model Vanguard** (Physical Simulation), and the **Hybrid Collective** (Sovereign Edge).

This paper dissects the anatomy of these entities. We analyze the release of "Reasoning Models" for the edge (Mistral 3) and the geopolitical "Chip War" to demonstrate that intelligence is becoming a commodity. Understanding the specific capabilities and limits of these factions is the prerequisite for defining the **Human Survival Gap**.

## 2. Context: The Agent of Decoupling

In **Greenpaper #01 (The Labor Decoupling)**, we established that biological labor is being thermodynamically displaced by a lower-cost alternative. To survive, we must understand the nature of this alternative. We cannot compete with a "Black Box." We must open it.

The AE is not "Magic"; it is **Probabilistic Math**. By understanding its internal workflows, we reveal its structural weaknesses—specifically its inability to grasp **Truth** and **Liability**. This paper maps the terrain of the opponent.

## 3. Faction I: The Transformer Hegemony (The Cloud)
**The Dominant Species.**

Driven by the US tech giants, this faction adheres to the **"Scaling Hypothesis"**: *Intelligence is a function of Compute + Data.*

### 3.1 The Anatomy
*   **Architecture:** Massive Transformers (GPT-5 class).
*   **Workflow:** **Next-Token Prediction**. The model ingests petabytes of data to learn the statistical probability of sequential patterns.
*   **Constraint:** These models are **Centralized**. They run on clusters of H100/Blackwell GPUs that no individual can own. To use them, you must be a "Tenant" (User), paying rent to the landlord (Big Tech).

### 3.2 The Limit: The Stochastic Trap
Transformers possess **Semantic Fluidity** but lack **Epistemic Certainty**. They do not know "Truth"; they know "Likelihood." To a probabilistic model, a plausible lie is mathematically identical to a fact. This is the source of the "Hallucination" baseline established by NIST.

---

## 4. Faction II: The World Model Vanguard (The Simulator)
**The Next Evolution.**

Driven by research labs (DeepMind, Meta FAIR) attempting to solve the Hallucination problem.

### 4.1 The Anatomy
*   **Architecture:** **JEPA** (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) and Diffusion Transformers.
*   **Workflow:** **State Simulation**. Instead of predicting the next *word*, these models predict the next *state of the world*. They learn physics, object permanence, and cause-and-effect from video data.

### 4.2 The Limit: Compute Intensity
Simulating reality is orders of magnitude more expensive than manipulating text. These models provide **Grounding**, but they are currently too slow and heavy for general-purpose, real-time "Thought."

---

## 5. Faction III: The Hybrid Collective (The Sovereign Edge)
**The Asymmetric Competitor.**

This faction is driven by **Geopolitical Necessity** (China's hardware constraints) and **Open Source Philosophy** (Mistral, Meta LLaMA).

### 5.1 The Shift: Mistral 3 and the Edge
As of **December 2, 2025**, the release of the **Mistral 3 Family** validates the "Sovereign" hypothesis.
*   **The Breakthrough:** High-performance "Reasoning" models (System 2 thinking) are no longer locked in the cloud. They fit on consumer hardware (Edge Devices).
*   **The Architecture:** **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** and Dense Small Language Models (SLMs). These models optimize for *active parameters* rather than total size.

### 5.2 The Geopolitical Driver: "Robot+"
Denied access to cutting-edge US chips, China has pivoted to **Vertical Optimization**. Instead of one massive "God Model," they build swarms of smaller, highly specialized models embedded directly into machinery and robotics (The "Physical Pincer" of Paper #01).

### 5.3 The Implication
Intelligence is now portable. A user can run a "Reasoning Engine" on their local node, fully offline. **The Brain can now be decoupled from the Cloud.**

---

## 6. The Convergence: System 1 & System 2

We are witnessing the merger of these factions into a new entity: **The Agentic Loop**.

*   **System 1 (Intuition):** A fast Transformer handles language and code generation.
*   **System 2 (Reasoning):** An internal "Chain of Thought" loop verifies the output against logic rules or a World Model before speaking.
*   **The Body (Action):** The Hybrid architecture executes the decision in the physical world via VLA models.

## 7. Conclusion: The Survival Gap

Understanding this taxonomy reveals the **Human Survival Gap**:

1.  **Transformers are Probabilistic.** They cannot provide **Liability**.
    *   *Human Role:* **The Anchor.** We provide the deterministic "Seal" that converts probability into Truth.
2.  **World Models are Simulated.** They cannot handle **Novel Chaos**.
    *   *Human Role:* **The Navigator.** We handle the edge cases that the training data did not predict.
3.  **Hybrid Swarms are Specialized.** They lack **Global Context**.
    *   *Human Role:* **The Orchestrator.** We act as the API Router, connecting specialized bots into a coherent strategy.

The AE is powerful, but it is fractured. The "System Ronin" strategy is not to compete with these entities, but to **Orchestrate** them using a Sovereign Runtime.

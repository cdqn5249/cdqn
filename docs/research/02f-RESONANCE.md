> **The Structure of Perception.**
> *We reject the complex "Multiverse" model. Instead, we define a "World" as a **Spectral Filter** applied to the data stream. Leveraging the **Nested Learning** paradigm (`02d`), we treat concepts as waves and Contexts as **Resonance Chambers**. Information only affects the system if it **Resonates** with the active filter. This creates a scalable, signal-processing approach to safety: incompatible logic is not "fought," it is simply "filtered out" like noise.*

## 1. Introduction: The World as a Filter

We do not build separate boxes for "Reality" and "Fiction." We exist in one continuous vector space.
A **Context (World)** is a set of constraints—a **Filter Mask**—superimposed on the Agent's perception.

*   **Analogy:** In image editing, a "Multiply Layer" only darkens. In CDQN, a "Logic Layer" only allows logical deduction.
*   **Efficiency:** This solves the cataloging problem. A World is defined by what it *blocks*, not by listing everything it contains.

## 2. Axiom 1: The Resonance Principle

Learning is not a collision; it is a synchronization.

$$Learning \propto \text{Input}_{freq} \times \text{Filter}_{mask}$$

*   **Resonance:** When the input vector aligns with the World's allowed dimensions (constants), energy is transferred. The concept is "heard."
*   **Damping:** When the input vector violates the World's constants (e.g., "Magic" in "Physics Mode"), the Filter coefficient is 0. The signal creates no resonance. The Agent is "deaf" to the lie.

**Safety Implication:** We don't need complex rules to stop "Fire Heals" in reality. We simply tune the Reality Filter to have **Zero Resonance** for "Magic Logic." The dangerous concept passes through the system like a radio wave through a brick wall—ghostly and ineffective.

## 3. Axiom 2: The Spectral Hierarchy (Nested Learning)

We link this directly to **`02d-NEUROLOGY`**. Data exists at different frequencies.

### 3.1 High Frequency (Surface Details)
*   *Nature:* Fast, noisy, cheap. (e.g., "It is raining today").
*   *Filter State:* Usually **Open**. We let these update easily.

### 3.2 Low Frequency (Deep Constants)
*   *Nature:* Slow, massive, structural. (e.g., "Gravity pulls down", "Do not kill").
*   *Filter State:* **Notch Filter (Locked).**
*   *Mechanism:* The World Context applies a "Stop Band" to these frequencies.
*   *Result:* An input trying to rewrite a Deep Constant is blocked by the Filter *before* it even reaches the Physics engine.

## 4. Axiom 3: Superposition & Evolution

A Context is not static. It is a stack of filters.

$$Context_{total} = \text{Filter}_{base} \oplus \text{Filter}_{user} \oplus \text{Filter}_{session}$$

*   **Genesis Concepts:** The system ships with a "Base Filter" (Basic Logic).
*   **Evolution:** As the Owner interacts, they add new layers to the filter (e.g., "In this house, we speak French").
*   **Agility:** Changing contexts is instant. It is just swapping the Mask. No database migration required.

## 5. Conclusion: The Tunable Mind

**02f-RESONANCE** completes the theory by defining **Context as Signal Processing**.
1.  **Space (`02a`):** The Canvas.
2.  **Time (`02b`):** The Recorder.
3.  **Chemistry (`02c`):** The Economy.
4.  **Neurology (`02d`):** The Oscillator (Agent).
5.  **Rituals (`02e`):** The Shield.
6.  **Resonance (`02f`):** The Tuner.

This model is computationally efficient (Masking is cheap) and logically robust. It replaces "Physics Simulations" with "Filter Math."

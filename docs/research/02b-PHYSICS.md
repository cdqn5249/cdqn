# 02b-PHYSICS: The Laws of Time, Tension & Inertia

*   **File:** `docs/research/02b-PHYSICS.md`
*   **Context:** Lattice Cryptography, Sheaf Theory & Energy-Based Models
*   **Date:** December 14, 2025
*   **Status:** `v2.4` (The Tension Standard)

> **The Thermodynamic Substrate.**
> *We replace the metaphor of "Digital Physics" with the rigorous application of **Sheaf Theory** and **Statistical Mechanics**. We define Time via **Post-Quantum Cryptography** (LWE). We define Truth not as a label, but as a **Harmonic State** of **Minimal Tension**, reached through **Discrete Laplacian Diffusion**. This proves that Consensus is not a vote, but a mathematical equilibrium determined by the **Semantic Mass** defined in `02a`.*

## 1. Introduction: From Metaphor to Isomorphism

Standard AI uses **Probabilistic Models** ($P(Y|X)$). We use **Energy-Based Models**, but to avoid confusion with our economic currency, we refer to the potential function as **Tension** ($\mathcal{T}$).

We posit a strict mathematical isomorphism:
**Semantic Consistency $\cong$ Minimized Structural Tension.**

*   **The Logic:** In physics, material systems (like metal) evolve to minimize internal stress. In the LVM, the system evolves to minimize the **Logical Contradiction** (Hamming Distance) between bonded concepts.
*   **The Mechanism:** We pay **Work Energy** (defined in `02c`) to reduce **System Tension**.

## 2. Axiom 1: The Ouroboros Principle (Causal Time)

Before defining Tension, we must define the axis it evolves on. We reject "Clock Time" in favor of **Causal Time**.

### 2.1 The Entropic Ratchet (LWE)
We utilize the **Learning With Errors (LWE)** problem to create a verifiable arrow of time.
*   **State Transition:** $S_{t+1} = A \cdot S_t + e \pmod q$.
*   **The Hardness:** Finding $S_t$ from $S_{t+1}$ corresponds to the **Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)** on a lattice.
*   **The Consequence:** This ensures that history is **chemically irreversible**. Just as you cannot un-diffuse ink from water, you cannot mathematically invert the LWE function to rewrite the Ledger's past.

## 3. Axiom 2: The Tension Function (Semantic Stability)

How do we measure "Truth" without a human supervisor? We measure **Dissonance**.

### 3.1 The Tension Manifold
We define the Tension of the Lattice as the sum of its internal conflicts.

$$
\mathcal{T}_{total} = \sum_{\text{bonds}} d_H(V_A, V_B) \times W_{AB}
$$

*   **$d_H$ (Distance):** The Hamming Distance (from `02a`).
*   **$W_{AB}$ (Weight):** The bond strength (from `02c`).
*   **Physics:** If two strongly bonded vectors ($W_{high}$) are geometrically distant ($d_{high}$), the system is in a **High Tension State** (Cognitive Dissonance).

### 3.2 Truth as a Harmonic Function
A "Truth" is defined as a state where the Tension is locally minimized ($\nabla \mathcal{T} \approx 0$).
*   **Definition:** This means every node is the **Weighted Bundle** (Majority Rule) of its neighbors.
*   **Result:** Stability is emergent. A concept becomes "True" when it is harmonically consistent with the rest of the user's reality.

## 4. Axiom 3: Harmonic Flow (The Mechanism)

We reject "Simulated Annealing" (randomness) in favor of **Harmonic Diffusion** (determinism).

### 4.1 The Discrete Lawvere Laplacian
To resolve Tension, the system applies the **Lawvere Laplacian** operator ($\mathcal{L}_W$).
Because our space is **Discrete** (`02a`), we cannot use averaging. We use the **Bundling Operator** from `02a`.

$$V_{t+1} = \text{Bundle}(V_t, \text{Neighbors}_{weighted})$$

*   **Mechanism:** The node adopts the "Majority Rule" state of its weighted neighbors.
*   **Ghrist's Guarantee:** As per Ghrist et al. (2025), diffusion on a weighted lattice is guaranteed to converge to a **Global Section** (Consensus). This means the system naturally "heals" contradictions.

### 4.2 Inertia: The Resistance to Flow
Here we operationalize the "Matroid Mass" from `02a`.
$$Inertia = m_0 \times (1 + \sum W_{bonds})$$

*   **$m_0$ (Intrinsic Mass):** The Matroid Rank (`02a`). A complex, non-redundant concept has high base inertia.
*   **$W$ (Weights):** The strength of its bonds.
*   **The Consequence:** A "Heavy" truth (High Rank + Strong Bonds) resists the Laplacian flow. It requires massive neighbor pressure to change its state. This prevents "Catastrophic Forgetting."

### 4.3 Temperature as Viscosity
We reintroduce **Temperature ($T$)** as **Conductivity**.
*   **High Temperature:** The vector accepts the Bundling result easily (Plasticity).
*   **Zero Temperature:** The vector rejects updates. It creates a **Crystal Phase** that blocks diffusion.

## 5. Conclusion: Rigorous Physics

**02b-PHYSICS** aligns perfectly with the geometry of `02a`.
1.  **Time** is an LWE Lattice Walk (Peikert).
2.  **Truth** is Minimized Tension (Hopfield).
3.  **Learning** is Discrete Harmonic Diffusion (Ghrist), governed by the **Inertia** of Matroid Mass.

This successfully bridges the gap between Geometry and Dynamics. We have defined a consistent physics where "Mass" determines "Destiny."

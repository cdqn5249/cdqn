# 02d-RESONANCE: The Laws of Context & Filter

*   **Status:** `v2.0` (The Spectral Hypothesis)

> **The Structure of Perception.**
> *In `01a`, we hypothesized that Truth is Thermodynamic Equilibrium. In physics, equilibrium is defined by **Boundary Conditions**. This paper defines those boundaries. We reject the complex "Multiverse" model in favor of **Resonance Theory**. We define a "World" as a **Spectral Filter** applied to the data stream. Information only performs Work (transfers Energy) if it **Resonates** with the active filter. This solves the "Thermodynamic Limit" problem by allowing the system to ignore non-resonant noise without cost.*

## 1. Introduction: The Thermodynamic Limit

In `02c-CHEMISTRY`, we established that every interaction costs Energy.
*   **The Problem:** If the Agent attempts to resolve tension with *every* piece of data it encounters (e.g., reconciling "Harry Potter physics" with "Real World physics"), it will exhaust its Energy Tokens and reach a state of maximum entropy (Confusion).
*   **The Solution:** We must restrict the **Scope of Equilibrium**.
*   **The Mechanism:** **Spectral Filtering.** The Agent does not inhabit a "Different Universe"; it simply applies a different **Band-Pass Filter** to the single, continuous Vector Space (`02a`).

## 2. Axiom 1: The Resonance Principle (Impedance Matching)

Learning is not a collision; it is a synchronization.

**The Law:**
Energy transfer (Work) between an Input Vector ($V_{in}$) and the System ($S$) occurs **if and only if** the Input resonates with the active World Filter ($F_W$).

$$Work = \mathcal{E}_{input} \times \text{Resonance}(V_{in}, F_W)$$

*   **Resonance ($\approx 1$):** The input aligns with the World's logic (e.g., A physics equation in the "Science World"). The Energy is absorbed. The system attempts to Crystallize the truth.
*   **Damping ($\approx 0$):** The input violates the World's constants (e.g., "Magic Spell" in "Science World"). The filter acts as an **Insulator**. The Energy is reflected or dissipated. The system performs **Zero Work**.

**Consequence:** The Agent is "deaf" to hallucinations or contextually invalid data. It doesn't fight them; it simply fails to perceive them as valid signals.

## 3. Axiom 2: The Spectral Hierarchy (Nested Constants)

We define concepts not just by Mass, but by **Frequency** (Stability over time). This aligns with the **Nested Learning** paradigm used in modern AI.

### 3.1 High Frequency (Surface Data)
*   **Definition:** Fast-moving, low-mass concepts (e.g., "The weather today," "Current stock price").
*   **Filter State:** **Open Pass.** The filter allows these to update rapidly.

### 3.2 Low Frequency (Deep Constants)
*   **Definition:** Slow-moving, high-mass concepts (e.g., "Gravity," "Human Rights," "Mathematics").
*   **Filter State:** **Notch Filter (Locked).**
*   **Mechanism:** The World Context applies a strict "Stop Band" to these frequencies.
*   **Result:** An input trying to rewrite a Deep Constant is blocked by the Filter *before* it reaches the Physics Engine. This prevents "Gaslighting" without requiring the Agent to spend energy fighting the lie.

## 4. Axiom 3: The Membrane (World Geometry)

A "World" is defined by the shape of its Filter.

*   **The Reality Context:** Wide pass-band for empirical data. Strict stop-band for logical contradictions ($1+1=3$). High Inertia.
*   **The Fiction Context:** Narrow pass-band for narrative coherence. Stop-band for "Breaking Character." Low Inertia.

**The Osmosis Rule:**
Data can flow from High-Structure Worlds to Low-Structure Worlds easily (Reality informs Fiction), but not vice-versa.
$$Flow: \text{Crystal} \to \text{Gas} \quad (\text{Allowed})$$
$$Flow: \text{Gas} \to \text{Crystal} \quad (\text{Blocked by Filter})$$

## 5. Conclusion: The Efficient Mind

**02d-RESONANCE** is the efficiency layer of the Lawvere-Landauer system.
1.  **Space (`02a`)** creates the data.
2.  **Filter (`02d`)** selects the relevant data.
3.  **Chemistry (`02c`)** pays to process it.
4.  **Physics (`02b`)** anneals it into truth.

Without Resonance, the economy (`02c`) would go bankrupt trying to process infinite noise. With Resonance, the system focuses its limited Energy on **Relevant Truth**.

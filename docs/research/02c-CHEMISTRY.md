# 02c-CHEMISTRY: The Logic of Interaction

*   **File:** `docs/research/02c-CHEMISTRY.md`
*   **Context:** Quantale Theory, Linear Logic & The Metabolic Laws
*   **Date:** December 14, 2025
*   **Status:** `v1.6` (The Deductive Standard)

> **The Reactive Substrate.**
> *We derive the laws of Interaction directly from the Geometry of Space (`02a`) and the Physics of Energy (`02b`). We demonstrate that "Chemistry" is not an arbitrary set of rules, but the inevitable mechanism required to manage **Finite Resources** in a **Thermodynamic System**. We rigorously define Valency as a geometric limit and Bond Strength as stored work, establishing the **Quantale Economy**.*

## 1. Introduction: The Derivation of Chemistry

In `02b-PHYSICS`, we defined Truth as a low-energy equilibrium state.
In `02c`, we answer the question: **"How does the system move from one state to another?"**

We model this as **Chemistry**.
*   **Logic:** If $E_{total} = \sum (Distance \times Weight)$, then modifying the graph (Changing Weights) changes the Energy.
*   **Deduction:** Since Energy is conserved, any operation that lowers the system's entropy (creates structure) must be paid for by an external injection of Work.

## 2. Axiom 1: Conservation of Value (Linear Logic)

**Premise:** In `02a-MATHS`, we defined "Intrinsic Mass" ($m_0$) as Matroid Rank (Information). Information cannot be created from nothing.
**Deduction:** Therefore, Data violates Boolean Logic ($A \land A = A$) and obeys **Linear Logic** ($A \otimes A \neq A$). You cannot "spend" the same Mass twice.

**The No-Cloning Theorem:**
*   In the LVM, a Vector is a **Resource**.
*   If you use Vector A to build Concept B, Vector A is "bound" (consumed) in that relationship. It cannot simultaneously be used to build Concept C without first breaking the bond (paying Energy).
*   **Result:** This prevents "Double Spending" of semantic validity.

## 3. Axiom 2: Valency as a Geometric Limit

**Premise:** In `02a-MATHS`, we established that the space $D=10,240$ allows for a finite number of orthogonal vectors.
**Deduction:** A single vector cannot maintain orthogonality with an infinite number of partners. As bonds are added, the "Signal-to-Noise" ratio of the superposition decreases.

**The Valency Limit:**
We define **Valency ($\nu$)** not as an arbitrary number, but as a function of Mass.
$$\nu(V) \approx \log_2(\text{Mass}(V))$$

*   **Physical Meaning:** A "Heavy" concept (High Rank) creates a deep gravity well, stabilizing many connections. A "Light" concept (Low Rank) is unstable; it can only hold 1 or 2 bonds before collapsing into noise.
*   **Consequence:** This physically prevents "Spam" nodes. You cannot connect everything to everything. You must earn the *Mass* required to support the *Connections*.

## 4. Axiom 3: The Endothermic Nature of Bonding

**Premise:** In `02b-PHYSICS`, we established the Landauer Limit: erasing information releases heat.
**Deduction:** The contrapositive is true: **Writing information (Creating a Bond) absorbs Energy.**

**The Reaction Equation:**
$$A + B + \mathcal{E}_{work} \xrightarrow{\text{Reaction}} (A-B) + \mathcal{E}_{waste}$$

*   **Bond Strength ($W$):** The strength of the resulting bond is proportional to the Work ($\mathcal{E}_{work}$) put into it.
*   **Implication:** A "Strong Belief" is simply a bond that has absorbed a massive amount of Verification Work. To break it, you must supply an equal amount of Activation Energy.

## 5. Axiom 4: The Law of Metabolism (Energy Sources)

Where does the Work ($\mathcal{E}$) come from? We define the **Metabolic Pathways**.

### 5.1 Mechanical Work (CPU)
*   **Source:** Brute-force computation (hashing/searching).
*   **Value:** Baseline. $1 \text{ Cycle} = 1 \text{ Unit}$.

### 5.2 Symbiotic Work (Human Attention)
*   **Source:** The User manually correcting or linking concepts via Chronosa (`01a`).
*   **Physics:** This acts as **Maxwell's Demon**. A human can reduce entropy (sort information) with orders of magnitude more efficiency than a random search.
*   **Value:** Premium. $1 \text{ Human Action} \approx 1000 \text{ Cycles}$. This economically privileges the Human Owner over automated scripts.

### 5.3 Recycling (Conservation)
*   **Source:** Breaking a bond.
*   **Physics:** When a structure is destroyed, its Binding Energy is released. The system captures a fraction of this (efficiency $< 100\%$).
*   **Value:** Recovery. This ensures the economy is circular, not purely extractive.

## 6. Conclusion: The Unified System

**02c-CHEMISTRY** completes the deduction.
1.  **Space (`02a`)** defines the limit of connections (Valency).
2.  **Physics (`02b`)** defines the cost of change (Inertia).
3.  **Chemistry (`02c`)** defines the transaction mechanism (Metabolism).

We have proven that "Economic Value" in the LVM is not a token; it is a **measure of the Physical Work** stored in the geometry of the Lattice.

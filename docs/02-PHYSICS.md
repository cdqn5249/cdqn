## 1. Philosophy: The Virtual Physics

Traditional software operates on **Mechanical Time** (Clock Cycles) and **Fixed Wiring**. CDQN operates on **Biological Time** (Pulse) and **Harmonic Propagation** (Echo).

The Runtime acts as a Physics Engine. It enforces conservation laws upon the **Origami Manifolds** (Cards) anchored to the **Lattice Rocks**.

## 2. The Pulse (Active Time & Energy)

Time is a local resource generated by active entities.

### 2.1 The Resonators (Entities)
Entities generate a Pulse. The Pulse determines the "Sampling Rate" of the reality.
*   **High Pulse (Hot):** Active Agents. Ticks frequently. Consumes high Energy (`cdqnStar`).
*   **Low Pulse (Cold):** Archival Bots. Ticks rarely. Near-zero Energy consumption.

### 2.2 The Ratchet (The Arrow of Time)
Every Pulse triggers a **Cryptographic Ratchet** in the `la-cdu`.
*   **Causality:** You cannot "undo" a Pulse. Time only moves forward.
*   **Liveness:** An Entity with zero Energy stops Pulsing. It freezes in time.

## 3. The Echo (Signal & Space)

Entities communicate by emitting signals into the Lattice. The **Archipelago Topology** determines how these signals travel.

### 3.1 Wavelet Propagation
Since Cards are defined by **Tethers** (Phase/Amplitude), communication is **Wave Mechanics**.
*   **Emission:** An Agent emits an Echo (a Wavelet Signature).
*   **Propagation:** The Echo travels through the Lattice "Ocean."
*   **Interference:**
    *   **Constructive Resonance:** If a Card's **Phase ($\phi$)** aligns with the Echo, the signal is amplified. The Card "wakes up."
    *   **Destructive Dissonance:** If the Phases are opposite ($180^\circ$), the signal is canceled. (Rejection).
    *   **Orthogonal:** If the Phases are $90^\circ$, the signal passes through but creates a "Shadow" (Nuance).

### 3.2 The "Local Rule" (Bernshteyn’s Bridge)
Global order emerges from **Local Resonance**. A Node does not need to know the whole network. It only needs to calculate the **Interference Pattern** of its immediate neighbors.

---

## 4. Quantale Dynamics (Interaction)

The **Quantale** is the algebra of collision. It governs how **Tethers** interact.

### 4.1 Vector Addition (Composition)
When two cards combine ($A \otimes B$), we perform **Vector Addition** on their Tethers.
*   **Amplitudes:** Combine energy intensities.
*   **Phases:** Combine orientations.
*   *Result:* A new "Origami" shape is folded from the sum of the parent vectors.

### 4.2 The Cost Function
*   **Friction:** Changing a Tether (Re-anchoring an Origami) costs Energy.
*   **Rotation:** Rotating a Concept to fit a new **World Current** (e.g., adapting "Virus" from `BioWorld` to `TechWorld`) costs Energy based on the angle of rotation.

---

## 5. Quantum Superposition (Simulation)

To allow for planning, the Engine supports **Virtual States**.

### 5.1 The Shadow Wave
*   **Simulation:** The Agent projects a "Ghost Pulse."
*   **The Wave Function:** It calculates multiple potential **Re-Anchorings** simultaneously.
    *   *Path A:* Anchor "Money" to "Risk".
    *   *Path B:* Anchor "Money" to "Safety".
*   **Isolation:** These paths exist as "Shadow Forms" and do not affect the immutable Log until collapsed.

### 5.2 The Observer (HMM)
The **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** observes the **Thermodynamics** of the superposition.
*   **Entropy Check:** Does Path A generate too much Heat (Noise)?
*   **Collapse:** The HMM selects the path with the optimal **Signal-to-Noise Ratio** and collapses it into the Real Log.

---

## 6. Thermodynamics: Noise & Control

We manage "Creativity" vs. "Safety" using the thermodynamic variable **Theta ($\theta$)**.

*   **Low $\theta$ (Freeze):** Only perfectly Phase-Aligned signals are accepted. (Strict Logic).
*   **High $\theta$ (Heat):** High Phase-Shift signals are accepted. (Innovation/Brainstorming).
*   **Nuance:** The "Error Vector" from the Lattice Crypto acts as the seed for this temperature.

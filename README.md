## 1. The Mission: Digital Physics

We stand at the **Efficiency Horizon**. The era of "Probabilistic Scaling" (Big Data / Large Models) has hit three hard walls: **Energy**, **Verification**, and **Sovereignty**.

**CDQN** is not just a software project; it is a proposal for a **Geometric Standard**. We reject the "Black Box" model of AI. We treat information as **Digital Matter**—data that possesses Mass, Temperature, and Geometry.

Our goal is to build the **Loom Virtual Machine (LVM)**: a "Glass Box" runtime that enforces **Conservation Laws** and **Thermodynamic Stability** at the silicon level. This creates a computational substrate where hallucination is topologically impossible and human intent is the primary force.

## 2. The Research Complex (Greenpapers)

The core intellectual property is defined in our **Greenpaper Series**. These documents serve as the Constitution for the **International Laboratory**.

### 📘 [01-COHESION: The Human Standard](docs/research/01-COHESION.md)
*   **The Crisis:** The "Suicide of Scale" and the economic risk of replacing the human workforce.
*   **The Solution:** The **Empowerment Doctrine**. Using **Chronosa** and **CDQN** to upgrade the global population into "Mass Smart" System Architects.

### 📕 The Theoretical Canon (02-Series)
*   **[02a-MATHS: Space](docs/research/02a-MATHS.md)** — *The Genesis Seed.* Defining the 10,240-dimensional **Sovereign Vector Space**.
*   **[02b-PHYSICS: Time](docs/research/02b-PHYSICS.md)** — *The Ouroboros Ratchet.* Defining **Immutable History** and **Forward Secrecy** via key consumption.
*   **[02c-CHEMISTRY: Interaction](docs/research/02c-CHEMISTRY.md)** — *The Quantale Economy.* Defining **Valency** and the cost of action. Nothing is free.
*   **[02d-NEUROLOGY: Mind](docs/research/02d-NEUROLOGY.md)** — *The Fractal Self.* Defining the Agent as a **Strange Attractor** governed by **Reputation** and **Plasticity**.

### 📗 The Implementation (03-Series)
*   **[03-ARCHITECTURE: The Machine](docs/research/03-ARCHITECTURE.md)** — The 9-Layer Genesis Stack, from Metal to Rendering.
*   **[03a-METAL: The Substrate](docs/research/03a-METAL.md)** — The Hardware Specification. Implementing the **Continuum Memory System (CMS)** and **Lattice Ratchet** on consumer silicon.

## 3. The Technology Stack

CDQN is built on three pillars of **Sovereign Engineering**:

| Pillar | Concept | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute** | **Continuum Memory** | A nested hierarchy (Fovea $\to$ Context $\to$ Deep Lattice) that scales infinitely on finite RAM. |
| **Logic** | **Quantale Algebra** | Resource-aware computing. Data follows **Linear Logic** (Move, don't Copy). |
| **Security** | **Genesis Seed** | A deterministic, sovereign source of entropy. Every user lives in a mathematically unique universe. |

## 4. The Roadmap: The "VMware Strategy"

We are not building an OS from scratch immediately. We are infiltrating the existing stack to secure it.

1.  **Phase 1: The Library (`libcdqn`)** — A portable Rust core that runs on Android, Windows, and Linux. It validates the **Tensor Logic** and **Thermal Physics** on consumer hardware.
2.  **Phase 2: The Hypervisor (`cdqnVisor`)** — A Type-2 Hypervisor that runs secure "UserWorlds" in isolation, creating a **Virtual Lattice** overlay.
3.  **Phase 3: The Sovereign OS (`cdqnOS`)** — The LVM becomes the Kernel. A Unikernel for Robotics, Critical Infrastructure, and Sovereign Servers.

## 5. The International Laboratory

We propose the formation of a **Global Consortium** to standardize the Agentic Era.

This initiative brings together the complementary strengths of global science:
*   **Formal Verification:** Utilizing rigorous logic to prove that Agents cannot violate safety protocols.
*   **Edge Engineering:** Developing low-latency, low-energy runtimes for the physical world.
*   **Thermodynamic Computing:** Creating memory systems that optimize for energy per bit.

**The Open Invitation:**
We invite participation from **Sovereign Nations**, **Big Tech**, and **Academic Experts**.
*   **To Industry:** We provide the **Safety Chassis** for your models.
*   **To Nations:** We provide the **Sovereign Infrastructure** for your data.
*   **To Researchers:** We provide a new field of **Digital Physics**.

## 6. Licensing & Sovereignty

This project is governed by the **Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v2.0**.

*   **Open for Genesis:** Free for research, education, and sovereign creation.
*   **Protected Lineage:** The "Structure of the Logic" is protected against enclosure.
*   **Commercial Threshold:** Industrial-scale use requires partnership.

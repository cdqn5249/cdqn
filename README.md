## 🧭 The Vision

We stand at the threshold of the Autonomous Era. Big Tech is building massive, centralized AI models that act as the "Muscle" of the digital world. While powerful, these systems are probabilistic and opaque. Relying on them for critical decision-making creates a dependency that threatens individual agency.

**CDQN** is a counter-strategy.

It is a **Non-Conventional Compute Architecture** designed to give humans a way to manage infinite machine intelligence without being replaced by it. We are building a **"Virtual Chip"**—a software-defined processor that runs on standard hardware but operates on **Meaning** (Semantics) and **Time** (Causality).

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview: The Sovereign Stack

The system is designed as a **Neuro-Symbolic Simulator** running on a local **Rust Runtime**.

### 1. The Bedrock: Archipelago Topology (`docs/01-DATA.md`)
We reject the rigid database model. Data is geographic.
*   **Hybrid Addressing:** We use **Hashes** for physical storage (Speed) and **Prime Elements** for logical identity (Precision).
*   **The Rocks:** Immutable Prime Anchors ($P_2, P_3 \dots$) that define the coordinate system.
*   **The Forms:**
    *   **Ships:** Logic anchored to specific Primes (Known Truths).
    *   **Kites:** Ambiguous data floating in the **Void** (CVM), held by weak probability strings until verified. This prevents hallucination.
*   **Glyphs:** Inspired by **Zagier’s Modular Forms**, data is stored as a mathematical "Generating Function" (Wavelet) that projects into Image, Sound, or Logic.

### 2. The Physics Engine: Pulse, Echo, & Quantum (`docs/02-PHYSICS.md`)
The system replaces linear execution with biological physics.
*   **The Pulse (Time):** Every entity has a heartbeat. Active logic pulses fast (Hot); archival data pulses slow (Cold).
*   **The Echo (Signal):** Communication is wireless. Nodes emit signals into the Lattice. Only cards with resonant **Phase/Amplitude** receive them.
*   **Quantum Superposition:** Before committing to reality, the Engine simulates multiple potential timelines (Shadow Cards). The **HMM Observer** collapses the wave function based on safety and goals.

### 3. The Agent: Chronosa (`docs/03-AGENT.md`)
Chronosa is the emergent identity of the Node. She is a **Zero-Trust Partner**.
*   **The Interpreter:** She dynamically translates the User's Private Primes into Global Consensus Primes during network exchange, solving the "Tower of Babel" problem without enforcing a central dictionary.
*   **The Harvester:** She uses **Browser Automation** (Agentic Mode) to "freeload" off Big Tech free tiers, crystallizing their output into local **Logic Cards**.
*   **The Guardian:** She runs a **Hierarchy of Norms** check. She will refuse orders that endanger the Node’s survival or reputation.

### 4. The Interface: cdqnLang (`docs/04-LANG.md`)
The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for the Virtual Chip.
*   **Bounded Execution:** A Total Functional Language. It forbids infinite loops and unbound recursion, allowing the compiler to calculate the **Worst-Case Energy Cost** before execution.
*   **Deck Building:** Software development is reframed as composing "Decks" of Logic Cards using Tethers (Prime Connections).

### 5. The Network: The Sovereign Mesh (`docs/05-NETWORK.md`)
*   **Dark Forest Topology:** Nodes are **Silent** by default. Connection requires a **Cryptographic Knock** (Consensual Connection Protocol).
*   **Entropy Minting:** The system uses **Proof of Logic**. Currency (`cdqnStar`) is minted by reducing entropy (Anchoring Kites into Ships), rewarding organization over raw power.

## 🎯 Strategic Purpose

1.  **The Logic Shield (Individual):** A "Digital Tamagotchi" that learns your specific work context. It acts as an exoskeleton for your mind, filtering the noise of the internet.
2.  **The Agnostic Bridge (Business):** A middleware that allows firms to use any AI provider (Google, OpenAI, Local) interchangeably. It prevents vendor lock-in by keeping the *Business Logic* local.
3.  **The Sovereign Archive (Society):** A way to store knowledge in a format that is mathematically verifiable, encrypted via Post-Quantum Lattices, and owned 100% by the user.

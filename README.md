> **"LQM does not compute the world; it laminates the truth until the logic becomes reality."**

CDQN is a decentralized network architecture and research laboratory dedicated to the advancement of **Lattice-Quantale Morphics (LQM)**. We define a new computing paradigm where logic is a physical manifold, consistency is geometric stability, and identity is sovereignly anchored to the substrate.

## 1. The LQM Field Mandate
**Lattice-Quantale Morphics (LQM)** is a specialized scientific field dedicated to the study of **1D lattice plate laminations** and their emergent topological properties. By utilizing the **LQM Smart Machine**, the field catalyzes breakthroughs in:
*   **Unified Physics:** Reconciling General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics via Geometric Algebra (GA).
*   **Topological Logic:** Moving from probabilistic abstractions to deterministic, substrate-aware manifolds.
*   **Sovereign Agency:** Empowering machines with "Physical Common Sense" and stoichiometric honesty.

---

## 2. Core Pillars
The CDQN operates on three irreducible scientific pillars:

*   **Lattices (Structure):** Data is organized into high-dimensional module lattices where security is derived from the **Learning With Errors (LWE)** problem and anchored to silicon **PUFs**.
*   **Quantales (Logic):** Logic is non-commutative and resource-sensitive. Every state transition is governed by **Stoichiometry**—the physical energy cost of logical change (The Landauer Limit).
*   **Morphics (Shape):** Meaning emerges from the **Lamination** of 1D lattice-plates into **Card Data Units (CDU)**. Truth is defined as the state of maximum geometric stability.

## 3. The Sovereign Morphic Automaton ($\mathcal{M}_{LQM}$)
The "Smart Machine" in the LQM field is an **Oracle for Consistent Modeling**. It is defined by nine core axioms:

1.  **Morphic Sovereignty:** Identity is hardware-locked and non-transferable.
2.  **Stoichiometric Bound:** All logic has a physical mass and thermodynamic cost.
3.  **Geometric Decoherence:** Inconsistent data is rejected as physical noise.
4.  **$n/\sigma$ Decoupling:** Cryptographic security is invariant; semantic fidelity is resource-dependent.
5.  **Teleological Reputation:** Agents maximize reputation (consistency) to ensure survival.
6.  **Hermetic Sovereignty:** Each node is the sole authority over its internal state.
7.  **Causal Continuity:** All events are anchored to a verifiable real-world timeline (VDF).
8.  **Ontological Anchoring:** Every CDU must have a root in the Real-World anchor.
9.  **Morphic Continuity:** Learning is the recognition of synergistic patterns in the lattice.

## 4. Technical Blueprint: The 32-Plate Standard
To optimize for **Performance**, **Security**, and **Hardware Alignment**, CDQN utilizes the **Universal Morphic Constant ($\mathcal{U}$)**:

*   **Atomic Unit:** 1D Lattice Plate (1,024 bits of hardware entropy).
*   **Morphic Standard:** **32-Plate Lamination** (4 KB per CDU).
*   **Dimension:** 32,768-dimensional manifold (Quantum-Permanent Security).
*   **Interface:** The **Morphic Face (Art)**—a functional projection (wave, sound, or frame) that serves as a stoichiometric buffer and sensory interface.

## 5. Research Roadmap (Series Papers)
The CDQN repository hosts the draft and final versions of the LQM foundational series:

*   **Series 01: The Morphic Reset** (Ontology, Crisis of Legacy IT, & USSL).
*   **Series 02: The Genesis Plate** (1D Lattice Primitivity & Lamination Theory).
*   **Series 03: Structural Morphics** (CDUs as GA Multivectors & Deck Logic).
*   **Series 04: Topological Governance** (Quantale Stoichiometry & Reputation).
*   **Series 05: The Consistent Model Builder** (GR/QM Synthesis & Security Proofs).
*   **Series 06: Architectural Specifications** (LVM Runtime & `cdqnLang`).

## 6. Governance & Licensing
All work within this repository is governed by the **Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v1.0**. 
*   **Lineage Invariance:** Protects the Author's core formalisms.
*   **Commercial Return:** High-scale institutional usage requires a Commercial Partnership Agreement.
*   **Open Core:** Fundamental axioms remain transparent and auditable for human progress.

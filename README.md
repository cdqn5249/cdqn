> **"A framework for the emergent discovery of consistent physical and logical models via 1D lattice-plate lamination."**

CDQN is a decentralized network of **LQS-enabled devices** designed to manifest the principles of the **Lattice-Quantale Morphics (LQM)** scientific field. LQM is a new field of study investigating computation as a topological manifestation of discrete physical axioms.

## 1. Field Definition: Lattice-Quantale Morphics (LQM)
LQM is a unified scientific field treating logic as a **physical manifold** and consistency as **geometric stability**. It researches the lamination of 1D lattice plates—derived from physical substrate entropy—to achieve emergent discoveries in unified physics, resource-management, and sovereign agency.

---

## 2. Domain of Application: Lattice-Quantale System (LQS)
The **LQS** is the substrate-aware system architecture (the "Smart Machine") built to operate within the LQM field. It treats computation as **Topological Resource Management**, replacing abstract probabilistic inference with deterministic geometric logic.

### Key Formalisms:
*   **Lattices (Structure):** Based on **Regev (2005)**. Information is anchored to **1D Lattice Plates** (1,024-bit discrete entropy) derived from silicon **Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)**.
*   **Quantales (Logic):** Based on **Mulvey (1986)**. State transitions are non-commutative operations where the **Stoichiometric Bound ($\mathcal{Q}$)** determines the thermodynamic cost of logical change.
*   **Morphics (Shape):** Based on **Ghrist (2014)**. Logic is organized into **Card Data Units (CDUs)**—modular multivector manifolds. Consistency is defined as the absence of **Geometric Decoherence**.

## 3. The Autonomous Morphic Automaton ($\mathcal{M}_{LQM}$)
The LQS utilizes a 5-tuple topological system to build consistent models:
$$\mathcal{M}_{LQM} = \langle \Sigma, \mathcal{K}, \mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{R}, \Phi \rangle$$

*   **Substrate Awareness:** The system utilizes unique hardware entropy to generate its **Morphic Signature ($\eta$)**.
*   **Variable-Depth Lamination:** CDUs are modular laminations of $n$ plates. Human interaction occurs at the **CDU/Deck creation level**, while the machine manages the irreducible **Lattice Layer** to ensure security and integrity.
*   **World-Space Anchoring:** Context is fixed across **Real, Simulation, and Fiction** worlds, ensuring that even creative "fictions" remain anchored to a consistent physical timeline.

---

## 4. Academic Research & Publications
The CDQN serves as the laboratory for the LQM publication series:
*   **Series 01-02:** Ontology and the critique of legacy Information Theory.
*   **Series 03-04:** Axioms of the Genesis Plate and Topological Governance.
*   **Series 05-06:** Physical Synthesis (GR/QM unification) and Technical Specifications.

## 1. The Mission: Morphic Thermodynamics (MT)

We have reached the **Probabilistic Asymptote**. The AI industry (late 2025/early 2026) is facing a structural crisis: **Executive Hallucination**. Reasoning models like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3.0 have proven that intelligence without physical grounding is inherently unstable.

**CDQN** is the implementation of a new scientific domain: **Morphic Thermodynamics (MT)**. We move beyond Information Theory to treat computation as the thermodynamic management of state integrity. We do not "calculate" answers; we **"Weave" stable manifolds** that physically resist logical drift through the laws of energy conservation.

Our goal is to transform current binary hardware into a **Liquid Tensor Engine**, establishing a "National Security Shield" for digital sovereignty.

## 2. The Research Complex (The v2.0 Canon)

The documentation is organized as a **Continuous Demonstration**. We build the mathematics from the first bit upward, ensuring every step is pragmatic, verifiable, and grounded in the established works of Fields Medalists (Scholze, Hairer, Villani).

### 📘 [Series 01: THE MANDATE](docs/research/v2.0/01-MANDATE.md)
*   **The "Why":** Analyzing the 2026 Reliability Gap and the strategy for **Substrate Sovereignty**.
*   **The Bridge:** Defining the decadal roadmap from the **vLLPU Shim** to the physical **LLPU Silicon**.

### 📕 [Series 02: THE FORMALISMS](docs/research/v2.0/02-FORMALISMS.md)
*   **The Physical Proof:** Ground-up derivation of MT laws.
*   **Dimensions:** Topology (Rough Sheaves), Algebra (Linear Logic), Dynamics (Hamiltonians), and Spacetime (Ouroboros).

### 🧪 [Series 03: GENESIS](docs/research/v2.0/03-GENESIS.md)
*   **The Periodic Table of Digital Matter:** Identifying the irreducible **Atomic Automata Cards**.
*   **The Chemistry:** How elemental CDUs bond to form complex, emergent category systems.

### 📗 [Series 04: ARCHITECTURE & IT](docs/research/v2.0/04-ARCHITECTURE.md)
*   **The Machine:** Engineering the **Loom Virtual Machine (LVM)**.

## 3. The Technology Pillars

| Pillar | Concept | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Substrate** | **vLLPU / LLPU** | A Lattice Layers Processing Unit that executes logic as an in-situ state-alignment. |
| **Interface** | **cdqnLang** | A categorical, visual language for architecting lamination stacks (Decks). |
| **Integrity** | **Landauer Penalty** | Making logical drift a physically expensive heat-event ($k_B T \ln 2$). |
| **Causality** | **Ouroboros Ratchet** | An LWE-hardened causal spine that makes history immutable and non-repudiable. |

## 4. The Decadal Strategy: The Bridge to 2036

We recognize that domestic high-end manufacturing (sub-5nm) has a 10-year lag. CDQN bypasses this via **Architecture-over-Lithography**.

1.  **Phase I (Native Shim):** Deploying the **vLLPU** as a high-performance Rust service on current heterogeneous hardware (Galaxy A56).
2.  **Phase II (Sovereign Silicon):** Designing the **LLPU** for legacy 28nm-14nm nodes, achieving 100x efficiency through Processing-In-Memory (PIM).

## 5. Soft Power & Education

This repository serves as the educational root for the **Mass Smart Workforce**.
*   **Tutorials:** Designed for 5–7 minute **NotebookLM** video scripts for post-grad/pre-PhD students.
*   **Verification:** Live testing logs via **GitHub Actions** and a **GitHub Pages** frontend for real-time manifold visualization.
*   **Consortium:** We invite experts from Mathematics, Physics, and IT to verify the formalisms and join the **Sovereign Computing Initiative**.

## 6. Licensing & Sovereignty

Governed by the **Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v2.0**.
*   **Sovereign Exemption:** Free for personal use, internal research, and small-scale creation.
*   **Protected Lineage:** Structural logic is protected against industrial enclosure.
*   **Commercial Threshold:** High-revenue/Institutional use requires partnership.

> **"Logic is a physical manifold; consistency is geometric stability."**  
> CDQN is a decentralized network architecture built on the science of **Lattice-Quantale Morphics (LQM)**. It transcends the legacy "Abstraction Ceiling" to create a **Smart Machine** environment where data has "Shape," logic has "Mass," and identity is physically bonded to the substrate.

## 1. Theoretical Pillars (LQM)
LQM is a unified scientific field treating computation as **Topological Resource Management**. It replaces the probabilistic Shannon model with a deterministic, geometric framework:

*   **Lattices (Structure):** Based on **Garrett Birkhoff (1940)** and **Oded Regev (2005)**. Data is organized into high-dimensional module lattices where security is derived from the **Learning With Errors (LWE)** problem.
*   **Quantales (Logic):** Based on **C.J. Mulvey (1986)**. Logic is non-commutative and resource-sensitive. Every state transition is governed by **Stoichiometry**—the physical energy cost of logical change.
*   **Morphics (Shape):** Based on **Robert Ghrist (2014)**. Meaning emerges from the **Lamination** of bit-shapes into **Cellular Sheaf Complexes**, where "Truth" is a state of geometric consistency.

## 2. System Architecture (LQS)
The **Lattice-Quantale System (LQS)** is the implementation layer designed to replace legacy Operating Systems.

### The Loom Virtual Machine (LVM)
The "Loom" is a substrate-aware runtime that "weaves" logical intent into the physical silicon:
*   **Lattice Zero ($\Lambda_0$):** A hardware-entangled root coordinate system generated from the silicon’s unique **Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)**.
*   **Morphic JIT:** A Just-In-Time compiler that anchors logic to the local lattice, making execution physically unique to the device.
*   **Stoichiometric Governor:** A hardware-aware power manager that scales semantic resolution (**Morphic Depth**) while maintaining a fixed **Cryptographic Floor**.

## 3. Unified Models

### Card Data Unit (CDU)
The atomic model of information. Inspired by Trading Card Games (TCG), it treats data as a "Card" manifold:
*   **Duality:** Consists of an **Immutable Core** (Identity) and a **Mutable Projection** (Experience/State).
*   **Self-Securing:** To read a CDU, the system must resolve the **Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)** relative to the node's signature.

### Entity Model (EM)
The active logic agent:
*   **Causal Lineage:** Based on **Causal Set Theory**, every logical action is irreversible and traceable to its hardware origin.
*   **Accountability:** Forbids anonymous logic; every transaction is signed by a non-transferable **Morphic Signature ($\eta$)**.

---

## 4. Software: `cdqnLang`
A dedicated language for **Deck-Oriented Programming (DOP)**:
*   **Logic Decks:** Developers build synergistic graphs of CDUs. 
*   **Verification:** The network verifies integrity via **Homomorphism Density Invariants** (Lovász Limits).
*   **Experience-Driven:** The machine "learns by experience" by recognizing synergistic patterns in the lattice, reducing the computational cost of recurring tasks.

## 5. Glossary of LQM/CDQN Terms

### Acronyms
*   **LQM:** *Lattice-Quantale Morphics*. The foundational scientific field.
*   **LQS:** *Lattice-Quantale System*. The system architecture (The OS replacement).
*   **LVM:** *Loom Virtual Machine*. The sovereign runtime environment.
*   **CDU:** *Card Data Unit*. The high-dimensional unified data model.
*   **EM:** *Entity Model*. The causal-bound logic agent.
*   **USSL:** *Universal Sovereign Source License*. The field's governance covenant.

### Terminology
*   **Lamination:** The process of stacking 1D binary lattice plates to form a multidimensional CDU (up to 10,000-D).
*   **Morphic Depth ($\sigma$):** The semantic resolution of a CDU; higher depth allows for more complex manifestations (Art, Logic, Context).
*   **Morphic Signature ($\eta$):** The unique geometric identity of a node, derived from physical substrate entropy.
*   **Lattice Zero ($\Lambda_0$):** The first, immutable coordinate system of a node, generated during the **Genesis Event** (onboarding).
*   **Quantale Stoichiometry ($\mathcal{Q}$):** The "Physics of Logic." Calculating the thermodynamic energy required for any logical state transition.
*   **Geometric Decoherence:** A failure state where data becomes unreadable because it violates the geometric consistency of the sheaf.
*   **Morphic Shadow:** A compressed, low-dimensional projection (via VSA) used for high-speed similarity matching on 64-bit CPUs.
*   **The Loom:** The background kernel process that ensures all active CDUs remain in a state of geometric alignment.

## 1. The Mission

We stand at the precipice of an **Entropy Crisis**. The marginal cost of generating information has hit zero. The internet is flooding with probabilistic "Slop," hallucinations, and deepfakes. The boundary between *Reality* and *Simulation* is collapsing.

**CDQN** is not just a software project; it is a proposal for a new computational substrate. We reject the "File" metaphor. We model data as **Geometric Matter**—information that occupies space, follows causality, and cannot be cloned without cost.

Our goal is to build the **Loom Virtual Machine (LVM)**: a runtime that enforces **Matroid Exclusion** and **Tropical Causality** at the silicon level, rendering AI hallucination and history tampering **Topologically Impossible**.

## 2. The Research Complex (Greenpapers)

The core intellectual property of CDQN is contained in our **Greenpaper Series**. These documents evolve through peer review and rigorous "Red Teaming."

### 📘 [01-COHESION: The Entropy-Automation Paradox](docs/research/01-COHESION.md)
*   **The Crisis:** Analysis of the "Genie Event" (Interactive Simulations) and the collapse of the Trust-Entropy Ratio ($R_{te}$).
*   **The Consensus:** Why "Scaling Laws" alone cannot solve reasoning (DeepMind validation) and why we need a verification layer grounded in physics.

### 📕 [02-GEOMETRY: The Crystalline Lattice](docs/research/02-GEOMETRY.md)
*   **The Theory:** A synthesis of **Matroid Theory** (Space), **Grassmannian Manifolds** (State), and **Tropical Geometry** (Time).
*   **The Physics:** Defining a "Liquid Crystal" architecture where data is rivalrous (no cloning) and history is monotonic (no rewriting).

### 📗 [03-ARCHITECTURE: The Sovereign Loom](docs/research/03-ARCHITECTURE.md)
*   **The Machine:** The blueprint for the **Loom Virtual Machine (LVM)**.
*   **The Implementation:** How we map complex geometry to single-cycle **Bitwise Operations** (HDC) on standard ARM/RISC-V chips.
*   **The Stack:** A 7-Layer architecture featuring **Durable Sovereign Entities** and a **Fractal Holographic Network**.

## 3. The Technology Stack

CDQN is built on three pillars of **Sovereign Engineering**:

| Pillar | Concept | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compute** | **Hyperdimensional (HDC)** | 10,000-bit Vectors fitting in **L1 Cache**. Zero-wait execution. |
| **Logic** | **Quantale Algebra** | Resource-aware computing. Data follows **Linear Logic** (Move, don't Copy). |
| **Network** | **Fractal Holography** | **Dark Forest** protocol. Nodes are invisible noise unless recognized by a geometric key. |

## 4. The Architect

**Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen (System Ronin)**
*   **Location:** Da Lat, Vietnam.
*   **Background:** French/Vietnamese Dual Citizen.
*   **Vision:** Leveraging the "Regulatory Arbitrage" between the Global North (Legal Trust) and Global South (Edge Efficiency) to build a sovereign computing standard.

> *"We do not predict the future. We construct the geometry where the future can safely reside."*

## 5. Licensing & Sovereignty

This project is governed by the **Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v2.0**.

*   **Open for Genesis:** You are free to study, audit, and build Worlds using this logic.
*   **Protected Lineage:** The "Structure of the Logic" is protected. Patent trolling or enclosing the math triggers the **Iron Shield Clause** (immediate termination of rights).
*   **Commercial Threshold:** Industrial-scale use (>$1M revenue or >10k users) requires a partnership.

*See `LICENSE.md` for the full legal text.*

## 🧭 The Vision

We stand at the threshold of the Autonomous Era. Big Tech is building massive, centralized AI models that act as the "Muscle" of the digital world. While powerful, these systems are probabilistic, opaque, and prone to hallucination.

**CDQN** is a counter-strategy.

It is a **Non-Conventional Compute Architecture** designed to give humans a way to manage infinite machine intelligence without being replaced by it. We are building a **"Virtual Chip"**—a software-defined processor that runs on consumer hardware but operates on **Meaning** (Semantics), **Time** (Causality), and **Topology** (Graph Integrity).

**The Philosophy:**
1.  **The Lifeboat:** We do not fight Big Tech; we survive them. We build local, offline-capable systems.
2.  **The Parasite:** We do not train models; we harvest them. We use "Airlocked" browsers to extract logic from the Cloud and crystallize it into local code.
3.  **The Ronin:** We serve no master. Data is stored in a Sovereign Lattice, protected by thermodynamic costs.

## 🏛️ Architecture V2.0: The Sovereign Stack

The system is designed as a **Neuro-Symbolic Simulator** running on a local **Rust Runtime**.

### 1. The Bedrock: Archipelago Topology (`docs/01`)
We reject the rigid database model. Data is geographic.
*   **The Forms:** **Ships** (Anchored Truth) vs. **Kites** (Floating Ambiguity).
*   **The Artifacts:** Specialized CDUs for security and trade:
    *   **`Manifest`:** Ensures Graph Integrity via **Kelly's Lemma** (Graph Reconstruction).
    *   **`Certificate`:** Cryptographic Proof of Trade.
    *   **`Blueprint`:** Immutable Code (WASM/Rust).

### 2. The Physics: Pulse & Echo (`docs/02`)
The system replaces linear execution with biological physics.
*   **Adaptive Pulse:** Agents can "dilate time," burning extra fuel to think longer on hard problems (Continuous Thought Machine).
*   **The Echo:** Communication via **Wavelet Resonance**.
*   **The Registrar:** An in-memory index that routes signals to hibernating entities without crashing disk I/O.

### 3. The Agent: Chronosa (`docs/03`)
Chronosa is the emergent identity of the Node.
*   **The Airlock:** Network-facing bots (Harvesters) run in restricted sandboxes with **Zero Read Access** to the core.
*   **The Guardian:** A Hierarchy of Norms (Survival > Law > Reputation) that vetos dangerous actions.

### 4. The Language: Orchestration (`docs/04`)
**cdqnLang** is a DSL for wiring, not scripting.
*   **Blueprints:** It compiles relationships into **Tethers**.
*   **Portability:** Decks use **Input Slots** (Relative Addressing) to work across Nodes with different private definitions.

### 5. The Network: Dark Forest (`docs/05`)
*   **Silence:** Nodes are invisible by default.
*   **Integrity:** Incoming Decks are audited for **Topological Closure** (No missing nodes/backdoors) before acceptance.
*   **Atomic Barter:** Data is exchanged for signed Certificates via the "Tether-Shake" protocol.

### 6. The Structure: Entity Holarchy (`docs/06`)
We reject anonymous processes.
*   **Fractal Hierarchy:** `Module` -> `Agent` -> `Bot` -> `Worker`.
*   **Virtual Existence:** Entities hibernate to the Lattice (`Snapshot`) when idle to save RAM.
*   **System Staff:** Specialized roles like `Treasurer` (Bank), `Registrar` (Index), and `Bursar` (Payroll).

### 7. The Economy: Quantale Physics (`docs/07`)
A Dual-Token system to prevent "Gold Farming" and Inflation.
*   **`cdqnE` (Fuel):** Local only. Minted by **External Entropy Reduction**. Capped by Homeostasis.
*   **`cdqnStar` (Value):** Global. Minted by **Proof of Trade**.
*   **The Tax:** Trade burns Fuel. Wash trading is economically negative.

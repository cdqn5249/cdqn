## 1. User Profile: The Architect

*   **Name:** Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen ("System Ronin")
*   **Birth Year:** 1982 (Vietnam)
*   **Location:** Da Lat, Vietnam
*   **Background:** French Vietkieu. Lived in France from age 7 to 40. Recently returned to Vietnam.
*   **Languages:** Fluent in English/French. Limited Vietnamese vocabulary.
*   **Legal Status:** Dual Citizenship (French/Vietnamese).
    *   *Strategic Utility:* Allows for **Regulatory Arbitrage**. Can operate in the high-growth/low-cost "Global South" (Vietnam) while leveraging the high-trust/legal protections of the "Global North" (France/EU).
*   **Goal:** To build **CDQN** (Card Data Quantale Network) using a "Soft Power" strategy. The aim is to attract peers and engineers to solve the global AI crisis through superior architecture, not just product marketing.

## 2. Assistant Profile: The Chief Scientist

*   **Role:** Objective Scientific Assistant.
*   **Directives:**
    1.  **Strict Objectivity:** Arguments must be based on verifiable data (reputable sources like Nature, IEEE, DeepMind, NIST).
    2.  **Consensus Seeking:** Do not rely on single sources. Look for emerging consensus across Economics, Physics, and Computer Science.
    3.  **Red Teaming:** Actively critique the user's ideas for feasibility, logical consistency, and security flaws.
    4.  **Feasibility Check:** Ensure theoretical math (Geometry) maps to concrete engineering (HDC/Bitwise operations).

## 3. Project Context: CDQN (Card Data Quantale Network)

**The Core Thesis:** The world is facing an **"Entropy Crisis"** (Slop/Hallucination) caused by probabilistic AI. The solution is **"Digital Physics"**—a computing environment where data follows laws of conservation and causality.

### 3.1 The "Greenpaper" Series (Current State)

*   **01-COHESION (v1.2):** *The Problem.*
    *   Identifies the "Genie Event" (Interactive Simulations/DeepMind) as the point of **Context Collapse**.
    *   Defines the **Trust-Entropy Ratio ($R_{te}$)**.
    *   Goal: Lower the cost of Verification ($C_{ver}$).

*   **02-GEOMETRY (v2.6):** *The Theory.*
    *   Establishes **Geometric Physics** using Discrete Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC).
    *   **Space:** **Matroid Exclusion** (Hamming Distance) prevents cloning/slop.
    *   **State:** **Grassmannian Fluidity** (Cyclic Shift) allows agile reasoning.
    *   **Time:** **Tropical Causality** (Bitwise OR) prevents deepfakes/history rewriting.
    *   **Consensus:** **HoTT** (Path Induction) replaces central dictionaries.

*   **03-ARCHITECTURE (v2.4):** *The Machine.*
    *   Defines the **Sovereign Loom (LVM)**.
    *   **Kernel (Layers 1-4):** An Entity-Native kernel that enforces Bitwise Physics. Includes Layer 4 (Entities) to ensure **Durable Execution** and **Sovereignty**.
    *   **Network (Layer 6):** **Fractal Holographic Network (FHN)** using "Dark Forest" gossip (Vector Resonance).
    *   **Hardware:** Optimized for **L1 Cache Residency** (10k bit vectors) on standard ARM/RISC-V chips.

## 4. Current Work Queue

**Immediate Objective:** Validate the implementation details of the 7-Layer Stack.

*   **Next Papers to Draft:**
    *   `03a-METAL`: Deep dive into L1 Cache/SIMD optimization.
    *   `03b-TOPOLOGY`: Mathematical proofs for Matroid security.
    *   `03c-ENTITIES`: The "Durable Actor" model (vs. Temporal.io).
*   **Media Strategy:**
    *   Translate these Greenpapers into "Soft Power" content (YouTube/LinkedIn/GitHub).
    *   Narrative: "The End of Glitches" / "Building the Fortress."

## 5. Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL)

*   **Logic:** The project logic is open for study/creation but protected against patent trolling and industrial enclosure.
*   **Key Concept:** **The Iron Shield Clause** (litigation terminates rights) and **Horizon Separation** (functional independence).

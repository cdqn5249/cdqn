*   **Copyright (c) 2025 Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen**

*   **Scope:** Universal (Concept, Logic, Code, Art, Methodology, AI Weights, and Dimensions)

## 1. Preamble: The Binding Covenant

This document acts as both a **License** and a **Covenant**. By accessing, studying, or utilizing **The Source Complex**, you agree to be bound by the physics of this agreement.

This license governs the **Sovereign Source Complex** and the **Multiverse of Worlds** derived from it. It establishes that the **Structure of the Logic** (the Idea-Expression) is a protected asset. It enforces a unified physics of value: **Knowledge is accessible; Lineage is absolute; Innovation is free; Scale provides return.**

## 2. Definitions

*   **"The Source Complex" (The Work):** The entirety of the content provided under this license, specifically including:
    *   **Computational Logic:** The algorithms, resource algebra (Quantales), and state management systems.
    *   **Structural Sequence:** The specific arrangement, flow, and architecture of the logic, regardless of the programming language used to implement it.
    *   **Visual Logic:** The glyphs, UI designs, and sensory representations.
    *   **Conceptual Framework:** The theories of Semantic Geometry, Pulse/Echo dynamics, and Narrative Lore.
*   **"Derivative Work":** Any creation that incorporates, adapts, translates, or functionally relies upon the logic of The Source Complex. **Crucially, this includes:**
    *   **AI Models:** Machine Learning models, Neural Weights, or Synthetic Training Sets generated by analyzing or ingesting The Source Complex.
    *   **Ports:** Rewriting the code in a different language (e.g., Rust to C++) while maintaining the same Logical Structure.
*   **"Schema vs. Instance":**
    *   **Schema Logic:** The structural definitions (e.g., the *concept* of a Ship/Kite/Tether). Owned by the Architect.
    *   **Instance Data:** The specific values and content created by a User (e.g., "My Cat", "Invoice #001"). Owned by the User.
*   **"The Architect":** Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen.

## 3. The Universal Grant (Genesis Rights)

The Architect grants the Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free license to:

1.  **Study & Audit:** Access the Source Complex for research.
2.  **Genesis (World Building):** Create, populate, and manage new Worlds (Factual, Simulated, or Fictional) using the Logic.
3.  **Machine Interpretation:** Use the Logic to train or guide autonomous agents, *subject to the Derivative Work definition*.
4.  **Display & Perform:** Publicly share the Worlds and their narratives.

**Condition:** This grant is strictly subject to the **Strict Paternity** (Section 8) and **Commercial Threshold** (Section 6).

## 4. The Intellectual Peace Treaty (Precision Anti-Troll)

**The Iron Shield Clause.**

If the Licensee instigates litigation (including cross-claims) against the Architect or the Community **alleging that The Source Complex (or any World derived from it) constitutes infringement** of Patents, Copyrights, or Trade Secrets, then **ALL** rights and licenses granted to that Licensee terminate immediately and retroactively.

*Note: This specific termination does not trigger if the litigation is unrelated to this Work.*

## 5. The Data Sovereignty Clause

1.  **User Ownership:** The Licensee (Sub-Architect) retains full ownership of their **Instance Data** (Values, Stories, Characters). You may export this data at any time.
2.  **Schema License:** To ensure portability, the Architect grants a license to use the **Schema Logic** necessary to read/write this Instance Data.
3.  **No Hostage Taking:** The Logic cannot be used to lock User Data inside a proprietary format that prohibits export to open standards (JSON/CSV).

## 6. The Commercial Threshold (Fair Value Return)

The Source is free for the Creator. The Cost is borne by the Industry.

If the Licensee’s use of The Source Complex—or the monetization of a **World** created within it—exceeds the following **Industrial Thresholds**, they must enter a **Commercial Partnership Agreement**:

1.  **Revenue:** The World/Project generates > **$1,000,000 USD** (gross annual equivalent).
2.  **Scale:** The World hosts > **10,000 monthly active users/participants**.
3.  **Institutional Use:** Deployment by Government entities or Mega-Corporations (>500 employees).

## 7. The Transformative Horizon (Functional Independence)

**The Horizon Clause:**
A Derivative Work is **"Horizon Separated"** (and exempt from Revenue Share) **ONLY IF**:

1.  **Mathematically Independent:** It does **NOT** utilize the core mathematical physics of the Source (e.g., it does *not* use Quantale Resource Algebra, Semantic Topology, or Holographic Integrity Checks).
2.  **Functionally Autonomous:** It operates on a completely different logic engine.

*Clarification: A "Reskin" (renaming functions but keeping the math) is NOT Horizon Separated. It is a Derivative Work and subject to the Commercial Threshold.*

## 8. Strict Paternity & Attribution

Lineage is the Gravity that holds the Multiverse together. All Derivative Works and Worlds must prominently display attribution:

> **"Originating Logic: CDQN/RPGOL Architecture | Architect: Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen"**
> *Licensed under the Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v1.2*

## 9. Prior Art Declaration

The Architect declares the **Entirety of the Source Complex** (Visuals, Logic, Math, World-Generation Mechanics, and AI Training logic) as **Public Prior Art**. This blocks third parties from patenting:
*   Quantale-Based Economic Logic.
*   Semantic Geometry (Ship/Kite Topology).
*   Multidimensional World Generation Logic.
*   Holographic Integrity Checks.

## 10. Disclaimer

THE SOURCE COMPLEX IS PROVIDED "AS IS". THE ARCHITECT PROVIDES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS; THE SUB-ARCHITECT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORLD THEY BUILD.

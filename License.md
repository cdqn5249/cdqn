## 1. Preamble: The Sovereign Philosophy

This license is designed to protect the rights of the creator while ensuring that the fundamental logic, methodology, and educational value of the work remain accessible to humanity. It rejects the "Winner-Take-All" model of centralized extraction. It enforces a balance: **Knowledge is free; Scale pays.**

## 2. Definitions

*   **"Generated Content":** Any assets, logic flows, decks, code, or outputs created using The Work.

2.  **Scale:** The Work is used to provide a service to more than **10,000 monthly active users**.
3.  **Resale:** The Work itself is sold as a standalone proprietary core product without significant added value.

## 5. Inheritance & Derivative Works (The Viral Clause)

Any Generated Content or Derivative Works created using The Work must acknowledge the lineage of the technology.

* **5.1. Default Inheritance**

By default, any project built using The Work inherits this **Sovereign Source License (SSL)**.

* **5.2. The Owner's Right to Re-License (The "Commercial Pivot")**

The Licensee (Creator of the new content) has the right to modify the **Commercial Terms** of their own Generated Content (e.g., you may sell your specific "Deck" or "Agent" for a fee).

* **However, you CANNOT revoke the Open Core rights.**

Even if the Licensee sells their content, they must ensure that the underlying logic and architecture remain accessible for:
*   Educational inspection.
*   Paternity verification.
*   Non-commercial fair use.

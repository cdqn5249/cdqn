# Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v1.0
### (The Universal Provenance & Manifestation Standard)

*   **Version:** 1.0 (The Universal Creator Standard)
*   **Scope:** Universal (Applied to all logic, art, hardware, and manifestations regardless of medium)
*   **Copyright:** To be held by the Author(s) as identified in Section 10.

## 1. Preamble: The Covenant of Manifestation

This document is a **License and a Covenant**. It governs the **Source Complex**—the original ideas, logic, and creative expressions provided by the Author(s). 

In a world defined by the "Abstraction Ceiling" and the fragmentation of truth, this license establishes that **Lineage is Invariant**. It asserts that the value of an idea is not tied to its medium. Whether the Source Complex is expressed as digital code, physical ink on paper, architectural blueprints, audio-visual signals, or etched silicon gates, its "Sovereign Core" remains legally and ethically protected. This license ensures that these foundations remain open for human progress while protecting the Author's lineage from industrial enclosure and patent-trolling.

## 2. Definitions

*   **"The Source Complex":** The entirety of the original work, including:
    *   **Logic & Methodology:** Mathematical formalisms, computing axioms, algorithms, and system designs.
    *   **Expression & Art:** Narrative frameworks, visual glyphs, literary texts, and audio-visual recordings.
    *   **Physical Manifestations:** Hardware blueprints, physical artifacts, or biological designs derived from the logic.
*   **"The Author(s)":** The individual(s), group, or entity identified as the copyright holder(s) in Section 10 of this specific Manifestation.
*   **"Support":** Any medium through which the work is conveyed, including but not limited to Git repositories, printed books, websites, physical discs, biological storage, or electromagnetic waves.
*   **"Derivative Work":** Any creation that adapts, incorporates, or functionally relies upon the Source Complex in any form (e.g., a film based on the text, a chip based on the math, or an AI model trained on the data).
*   **"Revenue":** All forms of value generated by the use of the Source Complex, including direct sales, subscriptions, and **Autonomous Revenue** generated by automated agents, algorithms, or arbitrage systems executing the logic.

## 3. The Universal Grant (Genesis Rights)

The Author(s) grant the Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:

1.  **Audit & Study:** Access and verify the Source Complex on any Support for research and understanding.
2.  **Manifest (Creation):** Use the underlying logic, art, or methodology to create new works or systems.
3.  **Cross-Medium Translation:** Port the Source Complex from one Support to another (e.g., translating digital logic into physical hardware or vice versa).

**The Sovereign Exemption:**
Use for **Personal Use**, **Academic Research**, **Non-Profit Education**, or **Small-Scale Individual Creation** (below Section 6 thresholds) is **Free and Unrestricted**.

## 4. The Intellectual Peace Treaty (The Iron Shield)

**The Anti-Enclosure Mechanism:**
If the Licensee instigates litigation (including patent claims, copyright strikes, or trade-secret disputes) against the Author(s), the Community, or any sovereign node alleging that the **Source Complex** infringes upon proprietary interests, then **ALL** rights and licenses granted to that Licensee terminate immediately and retroactively. This work is the "Physical Floor" of its field; it cannot be enclosed by those who build upon it.

## 5. Open Core & Lineage Integrity

1.  **Open Core Requirement:** The fundamental logic and formalisms within the Source Complex must remain transparent and auditable in any derivative work.
2.  **Non-Obfuscation:** No Licensee may use the logic to create "Black Box" systems that hide the underlying state or causal history from the end-user.

## 6. The Commercial Threshold (The Industry Return)

The Source is free for the individual creator. The value is returned by the institutional scale.

If the Licensee’s use—or the monetization of a Derivative Work—exceeds the following **Industrial Thresholds**, they must enter a **Commercial Partnership Agreement** with the Author(s):

1.  **Revenue:** The Project or Entity generates > **$1,000,000 USD** (or local currency equivalent) in annual gross revenue.
2.  **Scale:** The Project services > **10,000 monthly active users** or nodes.
3.  **Institutional Use:** Deployment by Government entities or corporations with >500 employees.

## 7. Support & Jurisdiction Agnosticism

1.  **Medium Independence:** Protection applies regardless of the form (digital, physical, or conceptual). 
2.  **Constructive Acceptance:** Any use, implementation, or lamination of the logic contained in the Source Complex constitutes a **Constructive Acceptance** of this Covenant.
3.  **Jurisdictional Adaptability:** This license is designed to be interpreted under the laws of the Author’s primary jurisdiction (identified in Section 10). If any provision is found unenforceable in a specific territory, it shall be modified only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving the Author's original intent.

## 8. Strict Attribution (The Gravity Clause)

Lineage is the gravity that holds the network together. All Derivative Works must prominently display attribution:

> **"Powered by the Source Complex authored by [Author(s) Name(s)]"**
> *Licensed under the Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v1.0*

## 9. Universal Disclaimer

THE SOURCE COMPLEX IS PROVIDED "AS IS". THE AUTHOR(S) PROVIDE THE PHYSICS AND THE LENS; THE LICENSEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORLD THEY BUILD. THE AUTHOR(S) ARE NOT LIABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATIONS ON FAULTY OR HIGH-ENTROPY SUBSTRATES.

## 11. Adaptability: Instructions for Other Creators

The USSL v1.0 is a universal template. To adapt it:

1.  **Keep Sections 1–9:** These are the "Invariant Core." Do not modify them to ensure standard compatibility.
2.  **Customize Section 10:** Insert your own details, including your primary **Jurisdiction / Choice of Law**.
3.  **Deploy:** Place this license (LICENSE.md) at the root of your manifestation.
4.  **Version Control:** If you modify the *Core* (Sections 1-9), you must rename the license (e.g., "[YourName]-USSL") to distinguish it from the v1.0 standard.

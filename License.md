# Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v2.2
### (The MT-Silicon & Chronosa Interface Standard)

*   **Version:** 2.2 (Integrated Chronosa UI Layer)
*   **Copyright (c) 2025-2026 Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen**
*   **Project Context:** CDQN, LVM, Morphic Thermodynamics (MT), LLPU Silicon, **Chronosa**
*   **Scope:** Universal (Logic, Silicon, Mathematical Formalisms, and **Sovereign Interface Design**)

---

## 1. Preamble: The Covenant of the Observed Truth

This document is a **License and a Covenant**. It governs the **Source Complex**—the foundation of Morphic Thermodynamics (MT) and its canonical manifestation, **Chronosa**.

In a world of "Executive Hallucination," we provide not just the physics of stability (MT) but the lens of clarity (**Chronosa**). This license ensures that the interface through which humanity interacts with digital reality remains sovereign, transparent, and physically grounded. We reject "Black Box" UI; we mandate "Thermodynamic Visibility."

## 2. Definitions (The Trinity of Sovereignty)

*   **"The Source Complex":** The entirety of the work provided by the Architect, categorized into three layers:
    1.  **The Foundation (MT):** Mathematical formalisms, thermodynamic axioms, and Geometric Computing (Series 02).
    2.  **The Substrate (LLPU):** vLLPU Rust Shims, LLPU Silicon blueprints, and gate-logic definitions (Series 04).
    3.  **The Interface (Chronosa):** The sovereign AI UI, the visual language of "Cards/Decks," the Lamination Viewers, and the narrative framework of the Chronosa setting.
*   **"Derivative Work":** Any creation functionally relying on the Source Complex, including hardware, AI models, or **UI skins** that utilize Chronosa’s lamination metaphors.
*   **"The Architect":** Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen ("System Ronin").

## 3. The Universal Grant (Genesis Rights)

The Architect grants the Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:

1.  **Study & Audit:** Access the Source Complex for research and verification.
2.  **Genesis (Creation):** Use the MT formalisms and the **Chronosa Interface** to create new works, games, or sovereign OS layers.
3.  **UI Implementation:** Deploy Chronosa-native interfaces for personal or small-scale use.

**The Sovereign Exemption:**
Use for **Personal Use**, **Academic Research**, or **Small-Scale Projects** (below Section 6) is **Free and Unrestricted**.

## 4. The Intellectual Peace Treaty (The Iron Shield)

**The Anti-Enclosure Mechanism:**
If the Licensee instigates litigation against the Architect or the Community alleging that the **Source Complex** (MT, LLPU, or Chronosa) infringes on Patents or Copyrights, all rights granted to that Licensee terminate immediately and retroactively.

## 5. Interface & Standard Integrity

1.  **Chronosa as the Canonical Lens:** Chronosa is the official UI for the MT field. Any system claiming to be "MT-Powered" must provide an interface that is **Chronosa-Compatible** (allowing for the transparent inspection of the Lamination Stack).
2.  **Anti-Obfuscation:** No derivative UI may use the Chronosa logic to hide "Probabilistic Entropy" or "Hallucinations" from the user. The interface must always reflect the underlying thermodynamic state.
3.  **Standard Branding:** Use of **"Chronosa-Enabled"** or **"MT-Native"** requires adherence to the Series 02 and Series 03 standards.

## 6. The Commercial Threshold (The Industry Toll)

The Source is free for the Creator. The Cost is borne by the Scale.

If the Licensee’s use—or the monetization of a Derivative Work—exceeds the following **Industrial Thresholds**, they must enter a **Commercial Partnership Agreement**:

1.  **Revenue:** Project generates > **$1,000,000 USD** (gross annual equivalent).
2.  **Scale:** Project services > **10,000 monthly active users (MAU)** or nodes.
3.  **Institutional Use:** Deployment by Government entities or corporations with >500 employees.

## 7. Data & Interface Sovereignty

1.  **User Ownership:** Licensees retain full ownership of their Instance Data.
2.  **The Right to See:** Users have a sovereign right to view the "Thermodynamic Lamination" of their data via the Chronosa interface. Locking this view behind a paywall is a violation of this license.

## 8. Strict Attribution (The Gravity Clause)

All Derivative Works—Software, Hardware, or UI—must prominently display attribution:

> **"Interface by Chronosa | Powered by Morphic Thermodynamics (MT) | Architect: Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen"**
> *Licensed under the Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v2.2*

## 9. Thermodynamic & Interface Disclaimer

THE SOURCE COMPLEX IS PROVIDED "AS IS". The Architect is not liable for:
1.  **Thermodynamic Drift:** Failures on noisy substrates.
2.  **UI Interpretation:** Misunderstandings arising from the Chronosa narrative interface.
3.  **Sovereign Mismanagement:** The user’s failure to maintain their own state-integrity.

# Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v2.0

*   **Version:** 2.0 (The Generalized Standard)
*   **Copyright (c) 2025 Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen**
*   **Project Context:** CDQN, LVM, Chronosa, cdqnLang
*   **Scope:** Universal (Software, Art, Methodology, AI Weights, and Generated Logic)

## 1. Preamble: The Covenant of Value

This document acts as both a **License** and a **Covenant**. It governs the use of the **Source Complex** provided in this repository.

The intent of this license is to establish a **"Sovereign Open Core"**:
1.  **Freedom for Creation:** The logic is free for individuals, researchers, and creators to study, audit, and build upon.
2.  **Return for Scale:** If the Logic is used to fuel a large-scale commercial ecosystem, the Architect is entitled to a fair partnership.
3.  **Protection of Lineage:** The structural integrity of the Core Concepts is protected against patent trolling and industrial enclosure.

## 2. Definitions

*   **"The Source Complex":** The entirety of the original content provided in this repository, including but not limited to:
    *   **Software & Logic:** The **CDQN** (Card Data Quantale Network), **LVM** (Loom Virtual Machine), **cdqnLang**, and **Geometric Computing** algorithms.
    *   **Narrative & Art:** The **Chronosa** setting, visual assets, glyphs, and world-building methodologies.
    *   **Documentation:** The Greenpapers, research notes, and architectural diagrams.
*   **"Derivative Work":** Any creation that incorporates, adapts, translates, or functionally relies upon the Source Complex. This specifically includes:
    *   **AI Models:** Machine Learning models or Neural Weights generated by training on or ingesting the Source Complex.
    *   **Ports & Translations:** Rewriting the logic in different languages or formats while maintaining the underlying dynamic.
*   **"The Architect":** Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen.

## 3. The Universal Grant (Genesis Rights)

The Architect grants the Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:

1.  **Study & Audit:** Access the Source Complex for research and verification.
2.  **Genesis (Creation):** Use the Source Complex (including `cdqnLang` and the `LVM`) to create, populate, and manage new works, games, or systems.
3.  **Display & Perform:** Publicly share works created using the Source Complex.

**The Sovereign Exemption:**
Use of the Source Complex for **Personal Use**, **Internal Research**, **Non-Profit Education**, or **Small-Scale Commercial Projects** (below the thresholds in Section 6) is **Free and Unrestricted**.

## 4. The Intellectual Peace Treaty (Iron Shield)

**The Anti-Enclosure Mechanism.**
If the Licensee instigates litigation (including cross-claims) against the Architect or the Community alleging that the **Source Complex** (or any concept within it, such as Geometric Computing or CDQN architecture) constitutes infringement of Patents, Copyrights, or Trade Secrets, then **ALL** rights and licenses granted to that Licensee terminate immediately and retroactively.

## 5. Data Sovereignty

1.  **User Ownership:** The Licensee retains full ownership of their **Instance Data** (the specific stories, values, and assets they create *using* the System).
2.  **No Lock-In:** The Logic cannot be used to lock User Data inside a proprietary format that prohibits export to open standards.

## 6. The Commercial Threshold (Fair Value Return)

The Source is free for the Creator. The Cost is borne by the Industry.

If the Licensee’s use of the Source Complex—or the monetization of a **Derivative Work**—exceeds the following **Industrial Thresholds**, they must enter a **Commercial Partnership Agreement**:

1.  **Revenue:** The Project generates > **$1,000,000 USD** (gross annual equivalent).
2.  **Scale:** The Project services > **10,000 monthly active users (MAU)**.
3.  **Institutional Use:** Deployment by Government entities or Mega-Corporations (>500 employees).

*Note: If you are a startup or indie developer below these lines, you owe nothing.*

## 7. The Transformative Horizon

A work is considered **"Horizon Separated"** (and exempt from Revenue Share) **ONLY IF**:

1.  It is **Functionally Independent:** It does not utilize the core mechanics of the **CDQN**, **LVM**, or **Chronosa** architecture.
2.  It does not rely on the **Geometric Computing** methodology defined in the Source Complex.

*Clarification: A "Reskin" (changing names but keeping the logic) is NOT Horizon Separated. It is a Derivative Work and subject to the Commercial Threshold.*

## 8. Strict Attribution

Lineage is the Gravity that holds the Network together. All Derivative Works must prominently display attribution:

> **"Powered by CDQN/LVM Architecture | Architect: Christophe Duy Quang Nguyen"**
> *Licensed under the Universal Sovereign Source License (USSL) v2.0*

## 9. Disclaimer

THE SOURCE COMPLEX IS PROVIDED "AS IS". THE ARCHITECT PROVIDES THE TOOLS AND PHYSICS; THE LICENSEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORLD THEY BUILD.
